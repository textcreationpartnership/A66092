         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A proof to the firſt Aſſertion may be deriv'd from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of the <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> who (though <hi>Turtullian's</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie hath other ways figured Him) was, without doubt, in his Perſon the moſt beautiful among men, according to <hi>Pub.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> occular Teſtimony of him to the <hi>Roman Senate.</hi> The ſecond Inference hath been ſo frequently found true, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is (among the <hi>French)</hi> digeſted to a Proverb, <hi>Leſbornes &amp; les boiteux ſont tousjours meſchants. The Blind and the Lame</hi> (meaning naturally) <hi>are always vitious.</hi> And according to this Rule, the Poets Figured <hi>Therſites,</hi> which, though it failed much in <hi>Socrates</hi> Conſtitution, rendring the Phiſiognomiſt Judgement of <hi>Him</hi> but ridiculous: yet <hi>Socrates</hi> repaired again
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31280:7"/> the Dignity of his Art, affirming that <hi>He</hi> was by Nature ſuch as he had Figure <hi>Him,</hi> but by the induſtry of <hi>His</hi> Mind, He had reſtrained that Propenſion. For concluſion therefore, ſince few or none will ſo much as ſtrugle with one vitious Inclination, it will be far ſafer, that we ſhould guide our true Election by this Appearance, though but a frail one, ſubject to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then yet to hazard it in expectation of a Miracle. To which poſition may poſſibly be objected, that ſince we have limitted the Faculty of out <hi>Miniſter</hi> in Council, we ſhould as thereto onely proper, prefer the Abilities of the Mind, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupply the Defects of the Body, before the Integrity of the Manners, which follow but the complement of the <hi>Form,</hi> there being in matter of Advice more uſe of Reaſon then of Virtue. In anſwer to the firſt part of the <hi>Objection.</hi> It may be granted, that ev'n by the advantage of Exceſs (whereof the extern De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formities are but inherent ſigns) the ſoul <hi>more perfectly</hi> in ſome intemp'ratures may exerciſe ſome one peculiar Faculty of the Intellect, then in any one peculiar Temp'rature, how regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſoever, as the predominant Humour is more proper to the uſage of the Fancy or the Memory; but withal, becomes thereby inferior and defective in the reſt. So that we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, ſince by virtue of the <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, the Soul produceth her Action, and by how much more pure the Inſtruments are, by ſo much more perfect are the effects. The Spirits <hi>Animal</hi> receiving onely this excellence from the Equality of the Temp'rature, whereof the exactneſs of the Form is but the Character. It of neceſſity will follow, that from the agreement of the Elements, muſt iſſue the moſt excellent and pow'rful Harmony of the ſoul. To the ſequel of the <hi>Objection,</hi> we will only inferr, that it being too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to every ſenſe; how frequently frail Man doth make his <hi>Reaſon</hi> but a Proſtitute to his <hi>Luſt,</hi> not only to the abuſing of others, but to the deceiving of Himſelf; it will be requiſite to unite <hi>her</hi> to an Object nigher <hi>her</hi> own Nature, to preſerve her in her Purity. And conclude, that ſince the <hi>Almighty</hi> hath not onely excluded the <hi>Impetent,</hi> but the <hi>Deformed</hi> alſo from <hi>His Miniſtrie;</hi> We therein have ſufficient warrant, not to admit <hi>Him</hi> unadviſedly to <hi>Ours.</hi>

What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the firſt Diſtinction, will, queſtionleſs not meet a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31280:7"/> in affirming it to be requiſite, our <hi>Miniſter</hi> be a Native of that Common-wealth, o're whoſe affairs his Council ſhould preſide; inſomuch, as every Perſon hath a Peculiar and innate Affection for the Glory and Proſperity of his proper Nation. Nor are the <hi>Natives</hi> uſually ſo ſubject to the jealouſie of the People on the Miſcariages of publique undertakings, as <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens</hi> are accounted. Furthermore, <hi>Natives</hi> receive many other advantages in their early and frequent Habits, which <hi>Aliens</hi> commonly are not endued with. As the perfect knowledge of the National Laws, Cuſtoms, and Nature of the People, with the Facility and Elegance of the Tongue, to expediate or illuſtrate their Diſcourſes. The ſubject of the ſecond Branch inherent to <hi>His</hi> Parentage, preſents to our Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two Propoſitions whether our <hi>Miniſter</hi> may be accepted from a <hi>Noble</hi> or <hi>Ignoble;</hi> from a <hi>Detected</hi> or <hi>Incenſed</hi> Family. For ſolution to the firſt <hi>Quaere,</hi> we will unfold the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Advantages of <hi>Either.</hi> The onely Benefit <hi>Nobility</hi> can promiſe us in <hi>His</hi> Reception, is to give Luſtre and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to <hi>His Miniſtry.</hi> The Advantage Ignobility preſenteth us in <hi>His</hi> Admittance, is vulgar ſatisfaction. The Firſt yields, but at moſt, an Ornament to Rule. The Later but Licentiouſneſs in Rule. The Inconveniences wait on Nobility in <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> are <hi>Jealouſie</hi> and <hi>Faction.</hi> As appears between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> to the Tranſlation of the <hi>Romain</hi> Common-wealth. And between <hi>Hanno</hi> and <hi>Hannibal;</hi> to the deſtruction of the <hi>Carthagintans.</hi> The Diſadvantages attend on Ignobility in a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> are <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Contempt,</hi> as may be viſible in the tranſaction of Affairs, under the Miniſtry of ***** and Others to the ſhaking if not hazarding our Own. In the firſt Ambition moves more Imperceptably, as being more nigh the Object of the Paſſion. In the later more Impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as more removed from the Point it reacheth at; ſo that the Conſequence of our Argument will guide us to a Mean participating of the Nature of both Extreams, as moſt expedient to the execution of our <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond Propoſition conſiſting in Parts of different Nature, we may devide them in our Treaty; and firſt take that, which moves, whether our <hi>Miniſter</hi> may be accepted from a <hi>Detected</hi> Family. Of which queſtion ere we determine, it will be neceſſary firſt to propound Another, whether <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> or <hi>Puniſhment</hi> followed the Detection; if <hi>Mercy,</hi> the utmoſt Ground of our ſuſpicion can be laid but on the Seeds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, contracted from the Impreſſions of Nature, or of Diſcipline, which reaching to no farther certainty, the Party ſafely may be joyned to our <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> induced by Example of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> who happily convincing <hi>Cynna,</hi> by his proper Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31280:8"/> of his conſpiracy againſt <hi>Him,</hi> did both the Crime remit, and readmitted him with ſuch ſucceſs, that neither yet by him, nor any other ever after, was any Treaſon, that was viſible, or Practis'd, or deſign'd againſt Him.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Puniſhment</hi> hath followed the <hi>Detection,</hi> the Argument will meet with the divided Sequel of the Queſtion, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in one Currant, fall under the Capacity of One Solution, under the Figure of <hi>Incenſed.</hi> Although it may admit of ſome diſtinction in the Manner; as whether the efficient Cauſe were Juſt or Injurious, Direct, or but Collateral, Nigh, or Remote. Yet, ſince no Obſervation can preſcribe a Limit to Mans Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being generally o're partial Judges in our own Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; ſuch Circumſtances will afford but little Difference in the Conſequence. So that we may herein conclude of Both, under one firme Poſition, in a general Excluſion of them from our <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> The dangerous iſſue of Indignation in a <hi>Miniſter of State;</hi> whether juſt or unjuſt, ſprung from Injury or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, are truly figured in <hi>Cataline,</hi> who, ill-reſenting the Diſgrace of a Repulſe, when he ſtood to be <hi>Candidate</hi> in the <hi>Pontique</hi> Warr, contrived ſecretly the viſible ſubverſion of the <hi>State.</hi> And was not farr off from effecting it. Like evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may be inſtanced from <hi>Julian</hi>'s far more Juſt, though more unhappy Fury; who on the violation of his Daughter <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> in his abſence, imploy'd on publique exigents, was at Return, poſſeſt with ſo inveterate a hatred againſt the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Government, that he forthwith brought in the <hi>Moors</hi> to <hi>Spain;</hi> who, there in ſundry bloudy Conflicts, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, became at length Poſſeſſors of the Territories four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together. Nor do ſuch like <hi>Punctillio</hi>'s of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor produce leſs violent Paſſions in remote Succeſſions, <hi>They</hi> being of ſuch uſage in moſt Common-wealths, That it is held as neceſſary to the Continuance of their Reputation, to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Quarrels of their Predeceſſors, as for the ſupport of their Livelihood, to Adminiſter to their Goods. And though the Fury hereof oftner doth reflect upon ſome private Family, as the indirect Promoters, or ſecret Contrivers of ſuch Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Diſgrace, then on the Head or Body of the State, from whom it was immediately received. Yet are the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof too frequently, as fatal to the One, as to the Other: witneſs the incenſed Proceedure of <hi>Arron,</hi> who on his Adverſary's prevailing againſt him in a Plea indicted for the Raviſhing of his Wife, brought in the <hi>Gaules</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> to the ſubverſion of his Enemies, and Devaſtation of that Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>

It will be Fit <hi>His</hi> School ſhould be the proper Nation, and <hi>His</hi> Inſtructors the Converſation of the moſt Polliſht People in the ſame.

               <p>But perhaps ſome may here cautiouſly object; that ſince the whole ſcope out <hi>Subject</hi> ſeems properly to aim at, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth only on the Sufficience and Integrity of the Mind, which conſiſting not in the variety of <hi>Tongues:</hi> ſuch Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure will rather prove to us a Penible, Expenſive and uſeleſs Curioſity, then any regular or expedient Inſtitution. In which Objection we will paſs over the <hi>Two</hi> firſt <hi>Inconvenients</hi> which are but the peculiar Means unto the <hi>Acquiſition,</hi> as too mean Conſiderations to ſuſpend our <hi>Argument;</hi> not any thing Material or Excellent, falling in our Capacity to execute or attain without our <hi>Induſtry</hi> and <hi>Coſt.</hi> And in Anſwer to the uſe, alleadge, that no Treaty, either at Home or Abroad, can with Advantage or Dexterity be menaged, without the Knowledge of the Tongue, and Habits of the Nation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are to Agitate, there being certain <hi>Emphaſis</hi> of Speech and Graces in Action, peculiar to the Expreſſions and Practice of each Nation, which not rightly diſtinguiſht, may make ſo great and irreconcileable a Breach; as may poſſibly fruſtrate the intention of the Conſultation. How ſucceſsful in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Negotiations, agreeable Miniſters may be, is obvious to every Senſe, and how they can be ſo, without that which ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31280:9"/> render them communicable, is a Miſtery not yet explicable.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Object</hi> propounded to our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> is <hi>Letters,</hi> to whoſe free Acceſs, it will be neceſſary to be indued with the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, which (though not at preſent <hi>National)</hi> may alſo be to <hi>Him</hi> of farther uſe in Foreign Agitations, wanting <hi>Thoſe</hi> that are, and with all ſufficiently ſerve to the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch a part of <hi>School-Learning,</hi> as ſhall be requiſite to our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> which ſhall not need to be extended farther, then to lend <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Propriety</hi> to <hi>His</hi> Diſcourſe: And to free his Spirit from the Tirany of the ſtrangeneſs of it in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others Mouth. Not ſo far to handle <hi>it,</hi> to make it a Fetter to <hi>His</hi> Reaſon, a burden to <hi>His</hi> Memory, a ſervile anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>His</hi> Judgement, or a Diſcord in His Manners. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all which, it will be dangerous to encounter this many headed Monſter (ſuch more in Reſpect of diſagreeing Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in Pretenders to her Myſteries, then in her own Nature.) e're the Judgement be perfectly formed, and confirmed, leaſt what <hi>He</hi> thought to Maſter and Poſſeſs for the Advantage of <hi>His</hi> Natural Endowments, Poſſeſs and Maſter <hi>Him</hi> to the Captivity and Extinction of the ſame.</p>
               <p>Theſe with Dexterity handled, may prove ſuperficial Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments to our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but the more exactly uſeful and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to <hi>His Miniſtry,</hi> and in the Exerciſe whereof. <hi>He</hi> ought ſolely to imploy all the Vigor and Induſtry of <hi>His</hi> Mind, are the <hi>Laws</hi> Common or National, Civil or Univerſal.

This was the ground of <hi>Philip</hi>'s <hi>Reproach to his Son</hi> Alexander <hi>the Great, when in the Olimpick Games, he bore away the Glory in Muſick from all his Emulators, implying that his Excellence herein was a ſhameful proof againſt him, to have been remiſs in time and Induſtry, in purſuit of other Endowments more proper to his Regal Dignity.</hi> The motions of the <hi>Civil</hi> Body can no more without hazard of Ruine ſuffer Ceſſation or Intermiſſion, then thoſe of the natural.

               <p>Another Argument may probably yet hereto be inſerted againſt the ſtrictneſs of our <hi>Miniſters</hi> attendance on his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, fram'd on the Multitude of Members, which may alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately ſupply each others vacancy: To which we may alledge, That it is the Bane of a Council, where the ſeveral Members Thereof rely upon each others Diligence, Sufficiency, or Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity; in which none anſwereth His peculiar Truſt, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth not his proper Conſcience, and inureth them to handle Publick Affairs (not having immediate Relation to their private Intereſts;) with that Indifference and Neglect, as if they not materially concerned Them. And farther lendeth an Advantage in Abſence of Particulars, to facilate the ſecret Practices of a Faction. Secondly, By ſuch Intermiſſion our <hi>Miniſter</hi> looſeth the preceding Coherences of ſeveral Agitations, whereby his Judgement cannot ſufficiently be enlightened for the future. Thirdly, To the exact conſtituting of a <hi>Council,</hi> is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a juſt Proportion, as well as a due Propriety of Parts. If they exceed in number, Diſorder will meet their various Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Obſcurity their mutual Conceptions, and Protraction their poſitive Determinations: ſo that in the iſſue ſmall fruit will follow their Conſultations: If they fall ſhort of a true Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it will rather be held a Private Combination then a Publick Convention. If they meet a perfect Symetry in their Union, we muſt then conclude, there being no one Superfluous, there will be no one conveniently to be ſpared; and if there might, on other ground then neceſſity (which admitteth of no Rule) ſuch Licence would be to the reſt, a juſt Plea for like Priviledge: ſo that in the diſmiſſion of one, we may perhaps often want the better part of our Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we figure our <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſo excellently endowed both in natural and acquired Habits, that no Age, how happy ſoever in the Production, or State ſo induſtrious in the forming, will at any time, with fertility beget ſuch a croud in this Society, that a ſupernumerary ſhall ſtill be ready to ſupply a Default. In Oppoſition hereto, may yet farther be alledged, that this is ſo ſervile and anxious a condition, that no generous or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Spirit (ſuch as is here pretended neceſſary) would ever be won to render himſelf ſubject to. This being granted, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceed from want of Love to his Countrey, Addreſs in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31280:11"/> Faculty, or uſe in the exerciſe: could <hi>Milo</hi> elſe, <hi>with delight on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Advantage of his ſtrength bear every day an Oxe?</hi> And ſhall not our <hi>Miniſter</hi> expoſe himſelf infatigably to the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of ſo glorious an enterpriſe, as the <hi>Common Welfare,</hi> which <hi>Scevola</hi> held dearer then his <hi>Hand, Regulus</hi> then his <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>Curtins</hi> then his <hi>Life;</hi> and will not only render his preſent Being uſeful, but neceſſary, and <hi>His</hi> memory not only vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but eternal: to which we inſtance not here the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>His</hi> Fortunes (which muſt follow as a conſequent) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too abject an inducement to bear any Influence over <hi>His</hi> nobler Inclinations: Nor will a plauſible Recreation be at any time wanting in the Excellency and Variety of our <hi>Subject,</hi> though not perhaps thoſe fancied by a looſer Temper: yet ſuch as are more proper to the Relliſh of that Age, we ſhall hereafter figure <hi>Him:</hi> ſo that we here inhibit not <hi>His</hi> Divertiſement, but only thereof change the Quality.</p>

               <p>WEre it ſo, that the Abilities of the Mind depended not on the Maturity of years, nor Experience on the frequency of Practice, as may be affirmed from the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of <hi>Alexander, Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in the early underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and ſucceſsful Iſſues of their Enterpriſes, whoſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Fortunes ſeem to have had a more ſecret Foundation than humane Reaſon can either frame or diſcover. Yet to educe ſuch Faculties to a uſeful Exerciſe, it were expedient, Time ſhould infuſe a perfect Allay to the natural Temper, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to withſtand the Proof of every tryal, whereby neither the high fervour of the Blood in Youth might be too prone to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the captive will to ſuch a wilde Temerity in Action, as to attempt on any Difficulty: nor yet the frigid ſloth of Phleame in Age might ſo benum the vital Spirits, as in a timid Jealouſie to reſtrain the paſſive will from ev'ry ſeeming oppoſition: Of which extrems the Danger to avoid, we Figure this our <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> of that <hi>Age,</hi> which Naturaliſts ſtyle, <hi>Aetas Conſiſtens,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 35. and 48.

                  </gap>s we ſo preciſely fix, as never to admit Exception in our choice, ſince many times we ſee, Nature her ſelf in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect or exact Diſpoſition of the matter, protracteth or anticipates
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31280:11"/> her courſe: but that we might receive a general Note to guide our purpoſe ſo nigh Perfection, as natural Lights may reach to.</p>
               <p>From which Argument ſome curious Fancy may perhaps collect Matter to inſert (if not by way of Oppoſition, by way of an exacter Propoſition) That it were better to form our <hi>Council</hi> of ſundry <hi>Ages,</hi> following herein the Pattern of a Natural Body, which is conſtituted in Parts of ſeveral Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to the end, that what One Member were defective in, might be ſupplyed by another.</p>
               <p>To which we may alledge, That Nature hath conſtituted the Body in parts of differing Tempers, in Reſpect of the Aptitude thereof to differing uſes and Miniſtries: And ſo having divers ends, muſt (of neceſſity, to the perfection of her work) make uſe of Inſtruments of diſtinct Capacities. But our <hi>Civil</hi> Body, though formed of ſundry Members; yet having but one only Object, It were rather more proper (if poſſible) that they ſhould ſo ſympathize in their tempers, that no one might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſſent from other in their natural Lights: But from their equal endowments might reſult an uanimous Agreement in their Conſultations.</p>
               <p>It may yet hereto farther be infer'd, That men are often more ſucceſsful in the ſearch of Truth, by interjected Doubts, and Oppoſitions formed from diſagreeing Opinions, then by the general Allowance of aſſenting Judgements, <hi>Which hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time condemned Truth it ſelf for Hereſie,</hi> and may perhaps be the Reaſon, why <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the multitude of Counſel there is ſafety.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This granted, by diſſenting Repugnances, Truth may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be brought to Light, but far more frequently, is by ſuch Conteſtation ſmothered in the Iſſue, leaving the Idea only of an unform'd Monſter. Moreover, if ſuch Diſcuſſions were needful to Truths Diſcoveries, theſe (ſo well as in obſtinate Differences) might be otherwiſe ſtated in Agreeing Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which though oftentimes but ſlenderly ſupported, wanting the Paſſion of a proper Owner; yet may they unto every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence, afford ſuch Lights, even in their firſt Diſcovery, as to diſcloſe the Neceſſity of their farther Agitation: which bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it ſelf but weight, will want no Proſecution.</p>
               <p>But we may peradventure meet with ſo repugnant a Spirit, as would attempt to force us out of our purſued Tract, with <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> Obſervation, <hi>That Affairs are ſeldom ſucceſsful, when ſifted ſo fine in their inherent Conſequences, as to admit no ſhare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Chance to work upon, which notwithſtanding will be the chiefeſt Agitator in the managing. Whence groſſer mindes are oftentimes more happy in their Conſultations, then more refined Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:31280:12"/>
               <p> To which we anſwer, That it is ſafer and more ſatisfactory to a generous minde, as <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaid, when adviſed to take the Advantage of the night to aſſail his Enemies more numerous then his Force, <hi>That he had rather ſuffer the injury of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, then the ſhame of his Victory.</hi> To fail under the conduct of that Light, God in Nature hath afforded us, then to be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful either in the Oppoſition, Digreſſion, or Omiſſion of her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, ſince every Age hath at leaſt his innate propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to peculiar Imperfections, it will be ſafeſt to accept of ſuch ſeaſons, as are moſt remote from the Extreams.</p>
               <p>Peradventure we may here yet meet the Authority of <hi>Solomon,</hi> as an Objection to our Argument, <hi>Whoſo often preferreth Gray Hairs to the Miniſtry of Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt Hereto ſo far agree, That <hi>Age</hi> (if rightly practiſed) wins great advantages to the Perfection of our <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> in the Obſervation of a long Series and Contiguity of Affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming ſtill the Judgement by an Occular Proof, whereby It conſequently becomes more viſibly effectual to a civil Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it muſt be with this Limitation, That ſuch years meet ſo perfect a Conſultation, as may retain Capacity properly to diſpence thoſe Notions.

               </head>
               <p>THis <hi>Particular</hi> in Relation to our <hi>Miniſter</hi> preſenteth three inherent <hi>Subjects</hi> conſiderable in Diſcuſſion. The <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Quantity,</hi> and <hi>Dependence</hi> thereof. But before we treat of the <hi>Branches,</hi> it will be requiſite to examine whither the <hi>Principal</hi> be neceſſary to our <hi>Subject.</hi> Since the Graces of the Mind may really conſiſt without the Benefits of Fortune: Nay, oftentimes by Her Repugnance, ſtanding exacter Teſts, become yet more refin'd; and in ſuch Conſequence, more uſeful to our <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we may reply, That <hi>Wealth,</hi> in the meaneſt Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can no way fall into conjecture, to be held Eſſentially, or Immediately neceſſary to the forming of our <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Yet weighing the collateral Impediments of Poverty; not only to the preceding Faſhioning and Introduction of our <hi>Subject,</hi> but to his preſent Agitations, we may affirm <hi>It</hi> obliquely in ſome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31280:12"/> meaſure to be requiſite in <hi>Him.</hi> Not meerly as a ſafeguard from ſuch Neceſſity as threatens His preſent Exiſtence. There being many other more remote Degrees of Indigence, which may prove obſtacles to the ſucceſs of this His <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> which are to be eſteemed ſuch; in Proportion to <hi>His</hi> private Charge and Quality.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in Reſpect of <hi>Himſelf.</hi> The burden of His own anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts, will render the Faculties of His Mind, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indiſpoſed, but unprepared to <hi>His Miniſtry. His</hi> Thoughts imployed, ſuſpended, or diverted on His proper Exigents, to whoſe forc'd Summons, Nature her ſelf will claim a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The inward Senſe of his own abject Fortune, redoubled by Reflection of the Majeſty of His own <hi>Aſſembly</hi> (if it encounter not an admirable Temper) will, Through the Dejection of the Natural Spirits, ſome time at leaſt reſtrain the vigor of his Argument, if not extingniſh It.</p>
               <p>In Reſpect of Others, the Inconvenients are, That <hi>His</hi> private Miſery may ſometime in <hi>His</hi> mouth render e'vn Truth it ſelf ſuſpected or neglected. <hi>Wiſdom from a poor mans mouth,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>being, or not approv'd, or not followed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, it ſeems not altogether conſonant to Reaſon, that publique Affairs ſhould be committed to <hi>His</hi> charge, who hath not a competent ſhare of Intereſts in the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action.</p>
               <p>To which we may yet farther add the caſual Frailty of our own infirm Natures, which thereby lays us open to the Battery of each Corruption; not onely in the Jealouſie of Others, but likewiſe may as far intreach e'vn on our own proper Apprehenſions. Since the <hi>wiſeſt Man</hi> that ever was, <hi>became Herein but diffident of His own Sufficience, unblemiſht, to ſuſtain the Tryal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concluding thus the Original of our preſent Diſcourſe, in ſome meaſure proper to our <hi>Subject,</hi> we will peruſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents hereto belonging, before ſpecified.</p>
               <p>From the <hi>Quality</hi> or Nature of His Poſſeſſions may ariſe Two Doubts. Whither we ſhall admit <hi>Them</hi> Moveable, Temporal, or Fundamental, National or Forreign. Both which Propoſitions will fall under the capacity of one Solution, which ſhall be, That the ſafeſt proceeding in our Election, is to aim at the firmeſt Pledges of <hi>His</hi> fidelity, we conſtitute to our Truſt, Not that we ſhall not hereafter be ſo cautious to exact of <hi>Him</hi> ſecurer Proofs of His Integrity. Nor yet at preſent ſo Scrupulous, as not to admit Him to our <hi>Miniſtry</hi> without the exact concurrence of ſuch Evidence, having e're this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Teſt of more Eſſential Tryals.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:31280:13"/>
               <p> To this Diſtinction in Order, ſucceedeth the <hi>Quantity</hi> of <hi>His</hi> Poſſeſſions, one extream hereof we have already handled with the preceding Principal; the other, that of courſe here falls in Agitation, is the exceſs of wealth (not ſuch in meaſure propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the fancy, but condition of the owner.) How deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Impoſtor <hi>This</hi> is to cheat the ſenſe, the wide worlds gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Homage to this Idol may be evidence, <hi>Who,</hi> to uſe <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigns</hi> Terms, <hi>judge of the Palfrey by his goodly Trappings: And believe my Ladies Chappein's an Eſſential part of Her admired Perſonage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How corrupt an aſſociate to the Owners Reaſon, ſacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hath to us atteſted, <hi>Figuring the Incapacity thereof to all that's good, under a humane Impoſsibility.</hi> Moreover, how nigh and tempting an Acceſs ſuch affluence may lend Ambition, not ſeldome only to the diſturbance of the common Peace, but to the Subverſion or Tranſlation of the whole Fabrick of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all Ages will afford us woful Patterns.</p>
               <p>Rejecting thus the extreams, as inconvenient in our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> it follows without farther conſequence, we muſt approve the mean, which from the reſult of our Argument not yet diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly figured to the ſenſe: We will propound It a Proportion ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable in a ſober Temper, to free the minde from the aſſiduous ſervility of others, or of His own occaſions: which end, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, more by the vigour of His proper Reaſon, then the Advantage of His preſent Fortune, will render Him yet more acceptable as viſibly more hopeful to our <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt inherent to this preſent <hi>ſubject,</hi> is the <hi>Dependance</hi> of our <hi>Miniſters</hi> Poſſeſſions; which we ſhall negatively include in one convertible Propoſition, That neither His Eſtate, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, depend by Tenure, Cuſtom, Homage, Copy, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on any others, then the Princes, or States, to whom he is Subordinate: nor yet that many others in like manner do depend on His.</p>
               <p>The former, if admitted, might perhaps form ſuch engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> as may enthral the freedom of His Spirit, and thereby ſometime caſt a private reſtraint on the Perſuit of publick Purpoſes; or wreſt ſome Publick motion to a Private Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The dangerous conſequence of the <hi>Latter,</hi> if admitted, too ſoon yields fuel to incenſed <hi>Miniſters,</hi> to become unequal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairers of their ſecret Diſcontents, as hath too oft appeared to the damage of this Nation; and formerly gave occaſion to a Cautious Prince, by ſundry Acts to take away the Ground thereof from all ſucceeding Ages.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Principle</hi> (rightly conſidered) will lead us to more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Eſſential Diſcoveries of our <hi>Miniſter's</hi> inward Temper, not ſo much in the borrowed Image iſſuing from the inſenſible Impreſſions our facile Nature receiveth from the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of our frequent Converſation; as in the innate Idea, others may thence collect of the ſecret and natural Propenſion of <hi>His</hi> minde, following therein ſuch Objects as ſeem unto <hi>His</hi> fancy moſt agreeable, which may be lights to guide us in Election. But chiefly (when conſtituted a member to this <hi>Aſſembly)</hi> we ſhall by way of advice interdict Him three Societies as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent to the Advantage of <hi>His Miniſtery.</hi> Of <hi>Bibbers, Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans,</hi> and Forreign <hi>Miniſters</hi> of State, under which Heads are figured to us the three eminent Strengths in Conteſtation for Preheminence in their Efficacy over the will of Man, <hi>Wine, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Wealth:</hi> Not that perhaps our <hi>Miniſter</hi> may not be of ſo excellent a Temper, as to reſiſt the Contagion of their contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Imperfections, though the common frailty of our own corrupt Nature may afford us hourly matter enough to entertain the exacteſt Virtue in unceſſant exerciſe, without attempting on ſuch Tryals, may in his failing, hazzard the common ſafety with <hi>His</hi> own. The Danger Hereof will appear more evident and weighty, when to <hi>His</hi> innate Infirmity, we ſhall Ballance the inſinuating force of theſe their Inſtruments with the full extent of their Operations.</p>
               <p>The Impoſturies of <hi>Wine</hi> firſt ſteal upon the warieſt Temper, under the Diſguiſe of Natures helpful Miniſtry, admitted thus in one Degree for uſeful; Cuſtom, at length, will in Another form it neceſſary. Mirth exalts the meaſure, and company pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth the exceſs, which not only ſmothers the Natural Light in Preſent, but diſables it in Future, leaving the irregular De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour ſo ridiculous, that what ſhould Grace <hi>His</hi> Dignity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts from <hi>His</hi> Authority: while the ſhallow Image of <hi>His</hi> thoughts hang on his fleeting Breath, and by the leaſt diſordered motion of the Heart, drops from his ſlippery Lips, perhaps to the betraying of the general welfare.</p>
               <p>But peradventure ſome may alledge, that our <hi>Miniſter's</hi> happy Conſtitution may as well gain this Advantage over others Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility, as Another over <hi>His:</hi> and that there are certain Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, to whom this Cuſtom is ſo proper, without the Proof Hereof, a <hi>Miniſter</hi> with them ſucceſsfully can ſeldom agitate.</p>
               <p>To which we may anſwer, That it is too uncertain, hazzar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and indirect a Procedure, to intruſt an equal portion of Affairs of this high Nature, but to the Advantage of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31280:14"/> Temper, to whoſe exact managing, the perfecteſt Lights of Reaſon or of Art, are ſcarcely capable: But were It granted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, there might be other Agents found hereto more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, whoſe Ignorance might anſwer for their Secreſie, and free the State from Caſualty of ſuch a Damage, without imbarking of an equal venture.</p>
               <p>How irreſiſtably the Charms and ſlights of wanton Womens Subtilties work on our ſelf-betraying Nature, lying in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, all Ages will afford us evidence, whoſe woful Proofs have not left Man the hope of a defenſive Armoir. To theſe, we finde in <hi>Sampſon, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> The ſtrongeſt to his Ruine, betrayed his ſtrength. The wiſeſt to the diſmembring of his State, his Knowledge. And the moſt zealous, to his Reproach, his Piety. It will therefore be no ſcandal to our <hi>Miniſter's</hi> Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience afar off to avoid this <hi>Precipice,</hi> become remarkable by the overthrow of ſo many eminent Perſonages; not only in <hi>His</hi> own Reſpect, but in Regard of publick Intereſts (by <hi>him</hi> to be preferr'd before <hi>his</hi> own) which lying in <hi>his</hi> Boſom, may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be incident to the like Diſaſter.</p>
               <p>Whereto may be objected, That there are alſo certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, with which our <hi>Miniſter</hi> may have Commiſſion to communicate, wherein the ſole, perfecteſt, and moſt material In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the occurrents of that Place, are only to be gained from ſuch Inſtruments, whoſe private Interview may farther be authorized from <hi>Cicero</hi>'s ſucceſs hereby in the Diſcovery of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talines</hi> Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>To which we make reply, That herein alſo (if aſſented to) the Ballance of our Argument remains but ſtill in equal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe; ſince in one and the ſame ſubject we may to the Faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Diſcovering, oppoſe the ſubtilty in attaining ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets: ſo that hereby we attempt to gain no more, then we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger to loſe.

                  <hi>Friend or Foe, have either private or publick Conference whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without the ſpecial Licence of the Senate.</hi> Which hath not (as ſome may figure) been enacted only, as a terror to ſuppreſs private practiſes; but clear contrary, hath in every Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance been proſecuted with ſuch blinde ſeverity, as hath in latter times, injuriouſly both to Themſelves and Others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely diſſected from their <hi>Civil</hi> Body <hi>(Anthonio Foſcarini)</hi> a Member of the greateſt Eminence, and perfecteſt Integrity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, ſuch before reputed, and after to their Grief and ſhame too late acknowledged. In which proceeding, ſince we ſeem to caſt a ſhadow of Reproach on ſo venerable a <hi>Society,</hi> and ſo univerſally approved Laws as hath induc't the ableſt Judgements to believe, That no <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction either hath had, or need to have firmer Baſis to the Eſtabliſhment of a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Government. It will be neceſſary to digreſs ſomewhat from our preſent Subject, both to expreſs and prove the Defects in ſuch Ordinance, as alſo in the Diſpenſation of the ſame. Briefly therefore we may Object againſt one Clauſe in the Edict, That it is againſt the Dignity and Purity of a Law to propound any Recompence to the Dilator, as pre-intending to ſuborn by ſuch Corruption falſe Witneſs to the Plea, and to invite the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent as well to ſuggeſt a Lye, as to diſcloſe a Truth.</p>
               <p>To which if inferr'd, the Neceſſity Hereof to a due Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; we may reply, That if the Vigor of a plauſible Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Common Cauſe, be not in every Peculiar Perſon ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently effectual to the vigilance of their proper ſafety inherent to the publick: yet, the never ſleeping Spies of Envy and Malice (to whoſe Perſecution the exacteſt <hi>Miniſters</hi> are moſt incident) will need no ſtipend to provoke their Fury.</p>
               <p>Againſt the incircumſpection of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> to this Decree, we may in this particular infer, That no Judge whatever, by the Nature of his Office, is tyed, ſo ſtrictly to depend on the Evidence of a Witneſs, as to neglect the circumſtance of the Matter, which divers times affords the exacteſt Lights to Truths Diſcovery, both without and beyond a farther Teſtimony; as appears in <hi>Solomon</hi> and <hi>Daniels</hi> Sentences: which, duly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, had not thoſe <hi>Miniſters</hi> admitted, the falſe Depoſition of a Band of Braves, would not have had the weight to over bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the juſt Renown of ſo vertuous, long approved, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a <hi>Miniſter:</hi> where the defenſive evidence was to be wav'd as irreceivable. But to come nigher to our preſent Subject, The true ground of this Law wants no other Authority to lend It conſequence, then the numerous Examples of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> thus corrupted almoſt in every Age.</p>
               <p>Not that we ſhall here declare a general ſuſpicion of our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> but to prevent the irreſiſtable motions of our common
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31280:15"/> Frailty from a dangerous iſſue. How forcible and prompt the means in Practice is to our Corruption; ſo obvious is to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Senſe, we only will inſert this antick Obſervation; That the <hi>Common union of the ſtrongeſt City is not of Force ſufficient to reſiſt the entry of an Aſſe laden with Gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, where no ſuch Inſtitution is of force, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral freedom licenſed, It will become the Prudence of our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> if wholly not to refrain ſuch Converſation, at leaſt to uſe it with ſo nice a Prudence as may not yield a ſeeming ground to others jealouſie of <hi>His</hi> ſincere Intentions.</p>

               <p>In His Agitations with Forreign <hi>Miniſters,</hi> we ſhall allow Him to aſſume more <hi>Majeſty,</hi> in Reſpect of the Dignity of the Nation he repreſents.

               <p>To which perhaps may be alledged, That the multitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no notions for poſitive Truths, or warrant of Their Own Sufficiency, but from the Tradition of the choiceſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, approved in the Agreement of ſucceeding Ages.

Moreover we may obſerve, in moſt General Councils, that men of greateſt Wiſdom and Integrity, have ſuffered the moſt obſtinate Oppoſitions in their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, either through Envy, Ignorance, or Inenmity, or elſe in favour of ſome ſecret Practices: which though examined with more freedom and Impartiality in remoter times; yet neither then want corrupt or perverſe Champions to ſhelter Their Defects: ſo that the Multitude; in the doubtful ſtrife (ſuſpended from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitive Cenſure) incline to that, holds moſt Advantage with their proper Intereſts, aſſuming ſtill the Authority to judge. From whence we may collect, That bluſtering Fame is but a doubtful Light to yield ſafe conduct to our Purpoſes, not only in reſpect of their premiſed Inſufficiency to judge, who forms her Nature; but in regard the vitious multitude can not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impeachment to themſelves, approve of ſuch are moſt to them unlike: ſo that a wiſe and upright man may have juſt Cauſe ev'n to ſuſpect himſelf in their applauſive Teſtimony: to which may alſo added be, the common Homage, moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the ſenſe and proper Intereſts.</p>

               <p> As all other Virtues are but ſubordinate Miniſters to theſe four, ſo the three latter of theſe ſeem to have an equal Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the firſt; <hi>Prudence</hi> being the general Rule and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs by which they all do ſteer their Courſes: and no longer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their own proper Nature, then contain'd within the Bounds of <hi>Her</hi> Preſcription <hi>Juſtice,</hi> if ſevere, becometh Injury; <hi>Fortitude,</hi> if unreſtrain'd, Temerity; <hi>Temperance,</hi> if not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified; Exceſs: So that their true Exiſtence is very properly ſaid to be ſeated in the mean, which to diſtinguiſh, Prudence ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Ballance to the Counterpoiſe.</p>
               <p>Antiquity diſtinguiſhed this Attribute, under the Figure of a youthful Virgin, viewing intentively her own Form in a Glaſs, implying the exerciſe of Wiſdom to conſiſt only in the Inſpection of our ſelves: According to the Inſcription on <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi>'s Temple, <hi>Noſce Teipſum;</hi> In which Ordinance <hi>Plato</hi> affirms <hi>Prudence</hi> only Conſtituted: and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> farther verifies the ſame in <hi>Xenophon.</hi>

But to inſiſt longer on the Deſcription of Her Character, were to detract from the Glory of Her Eſſence, preſcribing Limits to Infinity.

Plot and Counter-Plot muſt wait upon an Enterpriſe to crown the undertaking with ſucceſs, though ſometime they may ſeem divided: as <hi>Eumenes, Who ſeeing many Billets were in his Camp diſperſed by his Foe, to invite with great Rewards ſome greedy Temper to contrive his Death, aſſembled all his Troops by publick Proclamation; where highly exalting their approv'd Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to Him, with tender of a ſeeming gratitude: He publickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, thoſe Billets ſo diſperc'd, were but the ſecret Machines of his Love, by him contriv'd to gather nigher Proofs of their Affection.</hi>

The perſon under which ſhe is ſhadowed, intimating, Her ever flouriſhing and attractive Grace, implyed in the fertility and beauty proper to that Sex. Under the three other Diſtinctions is inferr'd the mutual Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Agreement of all Virtues neceſſary to the exact conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting One Another. <hi>Prudence</hi> ſeems intentive on the Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Ballance to diſtinguiſh of which ſide the weight of Right inclines. <hi>Fortitude</hi> hath arm'd Her with a Sword, and Courage to the Execution of a double <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> Puniſhment and Protection. Many, who only have conſidered this Inveſture of Juſtice, have erroneouſly figured to themſelves, that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Violence have laid the firſt Eſtabliſhment to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

To the Acquiſition of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Faculty, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary not only to make an exact ſearch into the Litteral and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſence and conherence of a Subject in Diſcuſſion, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to ſound the ſecret ground or purpoſe of ſuch a League, Covenant, Contract, Law, Decree, or Act whatever from the Collation of Times, Circumſtance, and Perſons, in which, for what, and by whom they were paſſed, enacted, or Confirmed. It being inconſiſtent with the Dignity of a Legiſlator, to catch at nice Terms, or Diſtinctions to ſhadow an evaſion from the true Intent. Or to leave ſuch Incongruities or Obſcurities in thoſe Decrees, Acts, or Commiſſions, formed by his Council, as may lend appearance unto ſiniſter Practices in Ambiguity, which may inſtead of Aids to the oppreſſed, become ſnares to the Innocent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Faculty, conſiſting of differing parts, muſt be aſſum'd from diſtinct Subjects. Power from the Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which <hi>He</hi> doth officiate. Courage from <hi>himſelf,</hi> to put that Power indifferently in Act; Both which we will conſider as immediately contingent to His <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> properly and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly ſeated in Advice. In Delivery whereof, <hi>He</hi> may in Right, challenge an unqueſtionable Priviledge of Liberty, being au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by the Election of a Prince or People, and the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>His</hi> own <hi>Society;</hi> not erring from the Propriety of Time, Circumſtance, and Order. A Conſultation elſe ſeems indirectly managed, concluding, or Impulſively, or Omiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And our <hi>Miniſter</hi> there poſited but a Cypher to lend more value to the Ordinance. It will appear a groſs piece of Mockery, to accept of any One to Council, but onely to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what others ſhall propound: Nor can the Advantage of Number claim a Right of Oppoſition, becauſe it may a Right of Inſtitution. The Integrity of that Vote muſt paſs but for ſuſpected, endeauours to avoid the exacteſt Trial. And Truth may ſometime ſo happly expoſe her ſelf unto One Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as <hi>his</hi> evidence in Her Diſtinction may overſway the Cenſure of a Multitude. <hi>His</hi> Power to agitate thus unpreſcrib'd,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:31280:22"/> will lend Him yet but ſmall Advantage to advance the publick Intereſt, unleſs <hi>he</hi> can attain like freedom from <hi>himſelf.</hi> If either the Gravity, Preheminence, or Reputation of others ſufficiency united or divided, fetter with Awe the Faculties of <hi>his</hi> minde in a ſervile Subjection, Dependence, or Relation.

               <p n="3">3. The latter Faculty is the ſuſpenſion of the Senſe from all exterior Objects. From this Obſcurity is <hi>Juſtice</hi> brought to Light: It will little avail the Diſpenſation of Rights, to be indued with a Judgement to Diſcern, and Power to determine, if the corrupted will diſguize the Impreſſion. How far the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick welfare ſhould weigh down all private Intereſt, is figur'd to us in the Integrity of <hi>Regulus, Who, being a Pris'ner to the, had freedom on his word to repair to his Countrey, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he would move the Senate in their Behalf to an Accord, and failing thereof to return to them.</hi> Regulus, <hi>on the firſt overture of the Propoſition to the Senate, finding them in Reſpect of his Safety to incline to an Agreement with their Enemies, laid open all the Damages that would thereby enſue unto the State, exaſperating them with earneſt Paſsion to reſtore the glory of their Arms in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their Enemies, which being aſſented to, They neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs oppoſed his Return, leſt the wilde fury of the barbarous Foe, hereby incenſed higher, ſhould act the vengeance of their Rage on him.

               <p>
                  <hi>Her</hi> Armature, being of differing Nature, Defenſive and Offenſive; inferreth diſtinct uſes, in Reference to one only Object, proper Safety.</p>
               <p>The Poſition of <hi>Her</hi> offenſive Arme implyeth <hi>Her</hi> Nature to be Acceſſably communicable,</p>
               <p>The Stability of Her Station would intimate the Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Her Reſolution.

Since we ſee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men (more through the Advantage of their Conſtitution, Paſſion, or Cuſtom, then the benefit of their Reaſon) have aſſumed ſuch a Habit of Reſolution in the Exerciſe of Arms, as ſeldom formed is, by the moſt regular Diſcourſe, the proper ſeat of <hi>Fortitude;</hi> which can admit of Ignorance nor Vice for an Aſſociate in <hi>Her</hi> Faculty.

               <p>If we ſhall yet farther weigh the Quality of <hi>This</hi> Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as proper onely to the uſe of Arms; we may poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm <hi>This</hi> Function to be only a diſtinct Subject of <hi>Her</hi> Exerciſe, no diſtinct property in <hi>Her</hi> Nature; which arms the Mind with a conſtant and uniform Reſolution againſt all

Yet in Reſpect the courſe of Armes (lending a more ample Theatre to <hi>Her</hi> Action) exalteth the Perfection of <hi>Her</hi> Eſſence, rendring Her Effects more communicable, we may allow <hi>It</hi> to be the moſt eminent Subject, whereon <hi>Fortitude</hi> can properly be illuſtrated.</p>
               <p>Which <hi>Subject,</hi> though not properly inherent to the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Yet ſince it accidently may aſſociate It, we ſhall deſire, that <hi>He</hi> may be indu'd with Faculties of Mind and Body proper to the uſe <hi>Thereof;</hi> not ſo much for the oſtentive Tryal of <hi>This</hi> His ſplendid <hi>Attribute,</hi> as in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of many other Advantages, redounding to the publique Benefit, which probably may enſue <hi>His</hi> Managing thereof: Being not only of approv'd Fidelity to warrant <hi>His</hi> peculiar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, and of a General ſufficiency of Mind to Order it; but by <hi>his</hi> frequency in Council, endued with a clear Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ev'n in the ſecret Miſtery of publick Purpoſes, more perfectly to guide <hi>His</hi> Enterprize.</p>
               <p>To appropriate more peculiarly <hi>This virtue</hi> to our <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> We will conſider the joynt <hi>Society</hi> of this our <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, as the Inſpiring Soul is to the exact compoſure of the Body. Thereby more viſibly to find the proper uſes of <hi>Her</hi> Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, under the Conſtitution of <hi>Her</hi> former Figure.

The proper ſeat of <hi>Fortitude</hi> from whence ſtill iſſueth Influence to animate the Members to <hi>Her</hi> Exerciſe, being (queſtionleſs) the joynt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance of the Interior Faculties of the Soul to a Rational Preſcription, reſulting from Diſcourſe.

               <p>Perſuing the Parallel in <hi>Her</hi> exterior Inveſture, we ſhall meet with ſome uſeful Notions in Reference to our <hi>Civil Structure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principle Parts of <hi>Her</hi> Armature, we will firſt conſider in their Nature, then in their Order or Poſition; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only Defenſive, informs us, that the moſt Natural and juſt Cauſe of taking Arms, is the oppoſition of the Aſſailant.</p>
               <p>The Order or Poſition Thereof intimateth, what Places in a Common-wealth are chiefly and ſoly to be fortified. The moſt Noble onely; as the Head, the Seat of Council, and the Breaſt, The Receipts of Commerce.</p>
               <p>The other part of Armature we will reviſe according to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:31280:23"/> the Nature, Number, Figure, and Faſhion thereof.</p>
               <p>The Nature Thereof being only offenſive; Implyeth that a State is but halfe ſecured, that ſtandeth onely on Her own Defence.</p>
               <p>The number thereof being only ſingle, inferreth the due Proportion of offenſive Arms, in reſpect of the Defenſive, which are double.</p>
               <p>The figure thereof being long, implyes the proper uſe of Arms of This Nature, ought to have extent, remotely mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from our <hi>Civil Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poſition thereof ſeated in a paſſive Poſture, inferreth, That a Nation ought to be inveſted with Arms of this Nature, as well for Ornament of Majeſty, as Uſe.</p>
               <p>To faſhion yet <hi>This</hi> Vertue to the peculiar uſage of our <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> whoſe advice only being to us of uſe. The exerciſe of This Virtue doth herein only tend to keep the ſource thereof <hi>(his Reaſon)</hi> clear untroubled and unblemiſhed. As the general Agreement of a Council to <hi>her</hi> preſcription, can only make a Conſultation uſeful. So the mutual concurrence of His Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Faculties to <hi>her</hi> order ſoly contributes to the exact form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>His</hi> Judgement. This is the proper ſeat of Council, and as the nobleſt parts muſt firſt be fortified againſt the aſſaults of all Licentious Paſſions, the only Enemies on which our <hi>Miniſter</hi> ſhall, in <hi>his Function,</hi> have occaſion to exerciſe <hi>this</hi> faculty, to keep His elevated thoughts in a tranquil ſerenity. The Fancy and the memory <hi>hereto</hi> communicate, are (as the Parts of <hi>Civil</hi> Commerce) next to be ſecur'd, leſt the <hi>Former</hi> precipitated or pre-poſſeſt, the latter ſurcharged or diverted, ſhould or corrupt, or elſe obſtruct <hi>his</hi> Judgement.</p>
               <p>The offenſive Arme he ought to uſe againſt the Incendiaries of this civil Inſurrection, is the reverſive Oppoſition of their mutual Force, one Paſſion being aptly ſuppreſt by the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another; yet not with freedom to their proper Motions, but under Reaſons Conduct, which only can yield every one a proper allay to their looſer Temper, and form their being uſeful to Her ſelf, waſting or diverting their harmful violence on One Another.</p>
               <p>The manner of <hi>His</hi> encounter with theſe Adverſaries, (as was prefigured) ought to be mannag'd at remoteſt Diſtance, it is not ſafe to cloſe or grapple with our Paſſions, but rather them to ſmother in their ſecret iſſues. Thus regulated, <hi>his</hi> very Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions will not only become uſeful, but graceful in Diſcourſe, and render him not only agreeable to others, but pleaſing to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

               <p>Such is the imperfect condition of humane Nature, that no ſooner handleth the faireſt pieces of <hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> but immediately it corrupts the ſame, rend'ring, ev'n in the exceſs.

               <p>This <hi>Faculty</hi> may ſeem to be more difficult then the reſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as her Nature is exercis'd on a more elevated Subject, regulating the ſecret Motions of their Properties: Other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues have more viſible Preſcriptions, But thoſe of <hi>This</hi> ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they ſeldom are exactly ſcrutable.

Yet with ſo ſmooth and uniform a pleaſure, as the <hi>Eudoſians</hi> (of that Sect, who only therein places the chiefeſt Good) <hi>under Her Conduct, form'd their high enterpriſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Antiquity figured <hi>This</hi> Virtue under the Dimenſion of the ſame Sex, as formerly the Reſt, holding a Cup full of Wine in Hor Hand.</p>
               <p>Under the ſhadow of which ſingle Action, implying the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of <hi>Her</hi> ſimple Nature: Of all vertues <hi>This</hi> gives us the nigheſt Pattern of Mans firſt Felicity. Other Vertues have more violent Efforts, and require more exquiſite Capacities in Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging: yet ſometime nevertheleſs, in their Severity, do ſeem to ſhock the Image of Natures Purity; which is to <hi>This</hi> a perfect Guide, and <hi>She</hi> to Her a faithful Miniſter.</p>
               <p>If we ſhall truly conſider the Idea of <hi>Socrates</hi> Diſcourſes; ev'n in the laſt and exacteſt Tryal of his Vertue, we ſhall evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently perceive, that the tranſcendent Excellence of his Minde was erected on the humble Scituation of <hi>This</hi> Virtue, neither in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31280:24"/> Sence or Demeanor figuring ſo much as the ſmalleſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Emotion, Force, or Conſtraint, but with that Calm Facility, delivering his Plea: as Vertue had in Him caſt off all Difficulty, the Foil lends Luſtre, if not Matter, to Her proper Eſſence: The Prize of Vertue conſiſting not in the High, but the orderly Exerciſe of the Soul; not in Greatneſs, but Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which regulateth every Faculty thereof, according to the firſt Inſtitution, and innocent Condition of Nature. To reflect more particularly on the Nature of <hi>Her</hi> Action figured, which ſeems to be the Regulation of that ſenſe, moſt prone to exceed in her Licentious Miniſtry, and in that Quality of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which ſooneſt ſeizeth on the Natural Light. Under the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>This</hi> Senſe of Taſting, is figured the Appetitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, as well as that of the Body.</p>
               <p>From the Nature of the Action, which is a neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to humane Nature, is figured the Neceſſity of the Work, whoſe end is, in the uſe, confined to <hi>Her</hi> meaſure. From the Poſition of the Subject, which is in Hand and View, we may collect, that the exerciſe of This Vertue hath only Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto Subjects, which fall within the Compaſs of our knowledge, Practice, and Poſſeſſion; In which reſpect, Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence is totally excluded <hi>Her</hi> Affinity.</p>
               <p>In the Quality of the Subject is figured the difficulty of the Work, both in regard of the volubility of the Matter, and the alluring Faculty of the Nature thereof.</p>
               <p>From: theſe figurative Diſtinctions, we may happily form ſome Notions eſſential to the uſage of our <hi>Miniſter:</hi> How ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary an Exerciſe <hi>This</hi> is, will appear in the Advantage or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the uſe, which tendeth to the due Regulation of every Senſe and Paſſion to the Miniſtry of Reaſon, the only light to all his Conſultations; which Paſſions are the very Springs that lend the Soul her proper Motion: which if extinguiſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſage of the Stoicks, <hi>the</hi> Soul, as <hi>Mountaign</hi> ſayes, <hi>Would remain uſeleſs in her Functions, like a Bark at Sea, ſuſpended from the ſuccour of the winde:</hi> But if the Paſſions were abandoned to their irregular Motions, Reaſon would be tranſported from her proper ſeat, with violence of the Agitation, and the exterior Senſes become diſabled to <hi>Her</hi> Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>In which Reſpect, that exceſs in the uſe of Wine ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly precede a Conſultation, as neceſſary to the Eſtabliſhment of Council, may juſtly be eſteem'd, if not a Contradiction, ſo groſs an Abſurdity, as no Cuſtom can Authorize, or example parallel: yet among the <hi>Perſians,</hi> it was an order ſo frequently and ſtrictly obſerved, that it became at length digeſted to a Rule; on what reaſon, ſo extravagant a Cuſtom ſhould be grounded: Reaſon it ſelf can ſcarce produce Conjecture, unleſs
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31280:25"/> it were by ſuch exceſs of Wine to animate or correct the vital Spirits in a defective Temper, become ſo through the innate Intemperature of the Climate, Age, Conſtitution, or Habit of the Practicers: Which uſage, in <hi>Mountaign</hi>'s Obſervation, ſo happily encountred the Temper of a <hi>Miniſter</hi> of State in his time, That he affirms <hi>His</hi> Enemies felt often the Effects thereof to the common prejudice of their Affairs. In which Regard perhaps the Diſcourſes of Philoſophers have handled this Vice ſo tenderly: And the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (who admit of no Emotion) have uſually diſpenc't with this, if not encourag'd It, unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the Spirits.</p>

               <p>To treat whereof diſtinctly e're we inſiſt, we ſhall reflect firſt on our <hi>Miniſter's</hi> Demeanor in reference to his Inſtitution of what kinde ſoever; and impoſe on <hi>Him</hi> a ſevere Interdiction, neither obliquely nor directly, by Perſonal Solicitation or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Interceſſion to move for His own Introduction, or any otherwiſe appear therein; ſuch Agitation being a procedure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unbecoming the dignity of <hi>His</hi> Office, The Perfection of <hi>His</hi> Endowments, and the Integrity of <hi>His</hi> Intentions,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Blemiſh to the Dignity of <hi>His</hi> Office, in regard ſuch Competition and ſiding, rather figure our Purpoſe an Object of our private Commerce, then of the publick Benefit, every man expecting to be advantag'd in their private Intereſt by Him they have advanc't to a capacity to farther it.

               <p>3. It farther renders His Intent ſuſpect to proſecute <hi>His</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with ſuch Ardency. Vertue, 'tis true, can have no nobler Object then the publick Good (which muſt exalt the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Her Nature) rendring her Effects more communicable: Yet her progreſſions are nor violent nor Irregular. Such Efforts may be ſhadowed with her Attribute, yet are but ſecret masks to Avarice and Ambition.</p>
               <p>To perſue the Order of our Diſcuſſion on the Diſtinctions of <hi>His</hi> Inſtitution. We firſt muſt agitate on <hi>His</hi> eſpeciall Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which ſoly and immediately depending on the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prince or State, the ſucceſs only reſts in their Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to which, ſince the capacity of Judging in a Prince, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes obſtructed by his proper inclination, Others Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or by a remote, reſerv'd or diſguis'd Communication. It were far ſafer to require the Preſentation of <hi>His Miniſter</hi> from the concurrence of the <hi>Society,</hi> to which he is to be a Member, under adjur'd Preſcription, That without fear or Favour, they ſhall impartially propound no Perſon to his Truſt, for any other conſideration whatſoever, then for the advantage they conceive <hi>he</hi> holds or'e other in His Sufficiency and Integrity. And leſt the Nature of this Method might bear ſome appearance to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31280:26"/> form á Faction. The whole <hi>Society,</hi> if of too large a number, may be reduc'd into a ſmall Committee, whoſe joint concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence onely ſhould have force to nominate the Pretenders, which might amount to ſuch a number, the Majeſty of a Prince might in the vaſt extent thereof, remain unblemiſhed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſpecial</hi> Election of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> under the ſole and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Authority of a State, requires more Caution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe more incident to Faction. The Election therefore (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Preſcription) ſhould yet be more obliquely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, removing it far from the Intereſſed, by changing ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times the Inſtruments thereof, who thereby ſhould exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded be from ſuch Pretenſion. No Elector near or remote, retaining, a Capacity to be Elected, after the <hi>Venetian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for example, The whole <hi>Society</hi> makes choice of Fifty Commiſſioners, which Fifty inſtitute Thirty, which Thirty ſelect Ten, which Ten Three, which Three determine only on the Election.</p>
               <p>The <hi>General</hi> Election of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> whoſe Inſtitution hath (with the Princes or States Authority) relation to the concurrence of the People, is yet of higher conſequence then the reſt; Inſomuch, as in ſuch conſultation, Laws are uſually enacted, reformed or repealed; new Impoſitions leavied, and weightier Enterprizes managed or deſign'd; In all which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the People make an eſſential Surrender of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Lives, and Liberties to <hi>His</hi> Truſt, without pretence of Reparation, the Iſſues being damageable, ſince licenſ'd by Their proper Act; It cannot therefore in reaſon, be a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warrantable in the ſelecting of this <hi>Council,</hi> to commit the eſtabliſhment thereof ſoly to the Direction of a ſhallow mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, whoſe ſouls do ſeldom move to other Object, then the ſenſe, prefiguring (in Reference to the Competitors,) ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who makes moſt frequent and moſt ſumptuous Feaſts, who lets His Tenants ſet at eaſieſt Rates, then who hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the faireſt proofs of Prudence or Integrity, both in the model of His private Oeconomy, and in the intercourſe of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Commerce. Furthermore, admit the Rabble of Capacity clearly to diſtinguiſh Agents proper to our <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> Their Eſtates for the moſt part, have too much dependance on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, to leave theirs ſo much liberty might make the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection free; ſo that of neceſſity, the rich only having advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the number of Tenants, acquiring the ſame in the number of votes, may claim <hi>His</hi> Introduction, by an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd priviledge, ſo fruſtrate, if not pervert the Intent of our <hi>Convention;</hi> which Inconvenients to avoid, we muſt collect a compound Method of Election from the preceding Models.

               <p>With all due reverence to our Legiſlative Power, can the allowance be adjuged equal? where the very innate form of Natures Rules (ſo ſweetly and infallibly guide every Beaſt by ſecret and inſtinctive Motives to the impartial preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their kind) may ſeem extinguiſhed.</p>

               <p>How common and ridiculous a Paſſion hath tranſported the ſence of man to perpetuate the glory of his Name by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of their Families, our Nation daily may afford too vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and deplorable proofs; where it is become a plauſible practice, to abandon their own proper iſſue, to raiſe their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory on ſo vain a ſhadow, that it wants frequently or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or relation to lend it a pretence to ſuch Inherency. <hi>This diſtemper of the minde deſtroy'd that Miracle of the world at</hi> Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>where the obſcured Actor wanting, or worth, or wealth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his memory, leſt dead he were forgot, would make his Name remarkable to all ſucceeding Ages by the eminence of his Miſchief.

               <p>That faction ſhould advance this Inſtitution, it is probable

               <p>The Intereſt of the Inſtitutor may hereto alſo concur, whoſe greatneſs conſiſting in the Power of his Homogers, did conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſuch Tenors to Poſſeſſions, as might no way be weak'ned by Diviſions, when ſummoned to his ſuccor.</p>
               <p>But the moſt material Inconvenience inherent to this <hi>Civil</hi> practice, is altogether repugnant ev'n to the very Nature and Primitive Intention of the Law, which is <hi>Civil Union;</hi> and ſo much the more prejudicial is the conſequence, by how much the Breach thereof is nearer the original of Unity, Amity, or Friendſhip, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, Legiſlators have in the eſtabliſhment of their <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, more regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then Juſtice it ſelf.

               <p>That the reflexion of <hi>Vertue</hi> (how remote ſoever) hath ever had a powerful Influence over the Spirits of ſucceeding Ages, is altogether unqueſtionable, whereon perhaps was grounded this Cuſtom amongſt the Lacedemonians, <hi>That, what Law or Advice was firſt propounded by a vicious Agitator, if approved of, ſome Perſon of an eminent Vertue was by the General Council immediately required to pronounce the ſame, leſt ſuch a motion ſhould want that Grace and Dignity, was requiſite to lend Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to the Eſtabliſhment thereof.</hi> But that the Inſtitutions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by perſon or Aſſembly ſo exactly qualified, form'd from no other Object then the particular Occurrence of thoſe Times, ſhould totally ſo o're-ſway the Judgement of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters, as to admit of them for unalterable Poſitions, beyond the confirmation of their own Diſcourſe, is but a ſervile

                  <hi>Power</hi> (ſimply poſited) though it may ſeem at firſt Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to claim a high and more legitimate Title to this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the affected Iſſue of ſuch eminence, yet when we more exactly ſearch into the ſecret nature thereof, in Relation to this Attribute, we ſhall ſo far diſſent to ſubſcribe to her Intereſt herein, we altogether ſhall ſuſpect her very appearance in the managing of a Legiſlative Tranſaction: inſomuch as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſions of an imperturbed Reaſon are ſoly requiſite to the due Conſtitution of a perfect Law, whoſe iſſue circumſcrib'd but by the meer Parado of a force is oftentimes obſtructed, if totally not ſubverted. Violence, though ne're ſo fairly poliſhed, bears but the exteriour ſemblance of a wrong: nor is it proper, that what intruding in our private Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, may legally diſpence us from the <hi>civil</hi> Ties of our own Act, ſhould be admitted to the Introduction of a common Ordinance. A due ordered force may, and muſt, of neceſſity, be the ſubordinate Miniſter to the Execution of the Laws, but not a preſident o're the Conſultations thereof. The order of our Argument, circumſpectly traced, will lead us to a conſequent without a propoſition; which is, that the moſt plauſible and unqueſtionable Authority of a Law is that, <hi>Which is formed from the free agitation of the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and faithful Miniſters, and eſtabliſhed by the unanimous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the people.</hi> According to this Method was even the Law of God publiſhed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and confirmed by the aſſenting Multitude; And if that holy and powerful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign would not exact an obedience from the work of his own hand (though tending only to their proper Benefit) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Covenant, which could no otherwiſe be conſtituted, but by conſent of parties. How irregular and unwarrantable are their proceedings, who violently impoſe a ſevere Ordinance to the reducing of their equals into ſervilty (altogether to their prejudice) not only without their liking, but abſolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the ſame. The primitive intention of a Law, is the good of the people, and how that ſhould conduce thereto, which ſhuns the teſt of common approbation, may certainly be term'd a Myſtery, but ſcarce receiveable in Equity.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, may be objected, that hereto as the Natural, ſo the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Body is incident to Infirmities, that ſometime may deprive It of capacity to reliſh their own Common Aliment, much leſs to leave it Faculty to diſtinguiſh of Artificial Remedies; which reaching not their Judgments, do often not affect their will. This being granted yet (of neceſſity) to apply the means to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31280:33"/> rectifie ſuch diſorder, the will muſt be prepar'd, or prepoſſeſt; convinc't with Reaſon, or intic't with Art: otherwiſe an open and repugnant violence will but exalt the Diſtemper, and ſo inſtead of repairing, or reforming, totally ſubvert the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. Such dexterity may palpably be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the common practices of the moſt prudent Legiſlators, on ſuch exigents, electing proper ſeaſons, and peculiar Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, profitably to inſinuate their purpoſes, where Reaſon was not prevalent enough to form their introduction. 'Tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the penible and dangerous enterprize of the Jews through the Deſart was deſign'd by Divine Providence, to reduce their unruly ſtubbornneſs to a more docile Temper, by ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly deſtructive ſtraits, more facily to introduce that ſacred Law, was to be tendered unto their ſubſcription: which yoke would ne're have been accepted of, in the fruition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd Land, the irregular motions of their will tranſported to a higher ſtrain by the Allurements of licentious Plenty.</p>

               <head>XXI. <hi>The Equality of the Laws.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FRom this Attribute the very Law it ſelf ſeeming to form her proper Nature, it may be judged altogether imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to lend thereto farther Diſtinction: yet when we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that every perfect Ordinance muſt (of neceſſity) have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference not only to the <hi>Offence,</hi> but to the <hi>Delinquent;</hi> and the <hi>Injured</hi> it will be very material to weigh the due Conformity, a Law ſhould hold with either.</p>
               <p>The true Analogy of a Law in Relation to the <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> be it either Omiſſive or Commiſſive, Publick, or Private, is an equal Reparation; on which Parallel was raiſed the ſevere Injunction of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth.</hi> On the deciſion of this due proportion, Juſtice in her Figure ſeems altogether intentive, in the firm Poſure of her hand to the exact Poiſure of her Ballance. Laws in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance may ſometime extend their weight beyond the Nature of the Crime, tending eſpecially to the publick uſe, by ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity to reſtrain the raſhneſs of Licentious Attempters: but in their execution ſhould ſecretly provide a charm to allay the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof, leſt that the <hi>Civil</hi> frame ſhould thereby elſe be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or Impoveriſhed. Thoſe Ornaments will ill become the Majeſty of a State, are become purple in her proper Gore; nor is it conſonant to the Dignity of a Law, to form a Commerce for Delinquency: As there are rewards for publick Offices, without the expence of the common Treaſure: ſo there are Penalties for publick Damages, ſubvert not Intereſts of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31280:33"/> Family. Which ne'retheleſs muſt with a nice diſcretion ſtill be managed: a danger to the State may equally enſue the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs, as the ſtrictneſs of a Law. In diſpencing yet of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Rights, the Law (without Impeachment) more firmly may adhere unto the litteral ſence thereof: Inſomuch as the publick Miniſtry is therein ſeemingly not much concern'd, but more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motely intereſſed, taketh away the Jealouſie of a partial Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. Edicts erected only for the publick Intereſt, ſeldom have other objects then the Obedience of the Members of the <hi>Civil</hi> Body; whoſe infringement may therefore be plauſibly repaired in a due Submiſſion. Decrees enacted to the ſupport of private Intereſts, have ſeldom other Object then the Deciſion of Right, whoſe infringement ſeems properly repaired in a feiſable reſtitution; yet ſince the violation of a private right is ſeldome perpetrated without indignity to the publick <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or Diſorder, a ſubmiſſive Penalty (of right) is thereto alſo, ev'n therein, to be conſtituted, the better to ſupport the Majeſty thereof; provided it may not be ſo conſiderable, to lend her the ſuſpition of a Party in the Tranſaction.</p>
               <p>According to this Diſtinction (in reference to the Deciſion of Private Rights) were <hi>Moſes</hi> Inſtitutions parallel'd: as in matters of Felony, <hi>He ſhall reſtore it double, and if he be worth nothing, he ſhall be ſold for his Theft.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Goſpel Inſtitution is, that <hi>He ſhall ſteal no more, but rather labour with his hands that he may be helpful to others.</hi> Which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs implicitly muſt thereby firſt infer a reparation to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured. Yet ſince all private dammage is inherently oppoſed in a common Conſequence to the publick Intereſt, if we ſhall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſider this crime as a breach of publick Commerce; the equilibriate thereof may ſeem to reach no vaſter Latitude, then publick Infamy. <hi>This the Lacedemonian Cuſtom viſed at, as the due Penalty to the attainture of a Felony; which otherwiſe, not ſurprized in the manner, was held a plauſible enterprize, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed but to acuate the vigilance and Invention of the people, to the preſerving and improving of their Properties.</hi> Which Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, (though not approvable in the uſe, that Virtue paſſing of neceſſity for ſuſpected, which holdeth but a ſhadow of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance with the Miniſtry of Vice: yet may we from the former preſidents (to the reſtraint of this Crime) form a mixt Method of our Punity, as more equivolently proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unto the nature of the Offence; compos'd of Reſtitution, and of Infamy: And although the latter may perhaps not meet with that Efficacy in our vulgar people, with whom this Crime moſt frequent is in practice; as it hath formerly incountred in the more elevated pirits of the Lacedemonian State, where the Impreſſions of Shame were ſo ſenſibly ingrav'd in their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31280:34"/> from their very Infancy, <hi>That a Boy having ſtole a Fox Cub, which cloſely he had covered with his Coat (jealous to be ſurprized in the manner) ſo much reſtrained the Emotions of Frail Nature in his tender years, as the very ſhadows thereof fell not under the Diſtinction of another ſenſe, until the ſtrugling Rape had made a paſſage through the very Bowels of the Attempter:</hi> but when ſuch Infamy is paſſed with a general Incapacity of publick Truſt, their proper Intereſts will enforce them to reſent it with more horror. To which, may probably be the cauſe, in reference to the infringement of the publick intereſt, in ſuch Treſpaſſes, our Laws do yet exact the Attainture of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons Goods.</p>
               <p>2. In perſuit of the Order of our Subject we next aſſume the ſecond conſequent involved in the Conſtitution of a perfect Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. <hi>The Delinquent,</hi> which although ſeeming totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the regulation of the Penalty to the Nature of the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence:</hi> and in poſition of a Fact implicitely therewith included as one common Individual: yet ſince the Rules of Nature, as well as Policy, have lent peculiar Diſtinctions to ſeveral Members of a Community (not falling all under one and the ſame meaſure of Capacity, and therewithal, as ſpecial Graces to their Dignities or Infirmities, inherent Priviledges; it will be requiſite to weigh how far ſuch Freedom may conſiſt with the integrity of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Ordinance. Omitting to diſcuſs on the Prerogative of Princes; as being a Subject of too vaſt a Latitude to be a branch of a peculiar Treatiſe, as alſo that they ſeldom agitate, but by their ſubſtitutes, who falling under the ſubjection of a Law, are not alwayes ſecluded from the common courſe thereof; or if ſometime they be, it ſeldom under ſhelter is of the Authority of a Law, of whoſe equality we only are in ſearch. We will proceed to agitate on the ſubſequents ſequeſtered either in Goods or Perſon, from the attainture of a publick Ordinance, by Virtue of their eminence, under three Principles, <hi>Peer, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Publick Miniſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Peer</hi> pretendeth for the ground of his Priviledge in relation to his Perſon, the neceſſity of his Attendance on the Prince, as the eſſential Luſtre to his Majeſty, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Goods, the vaſt expence which follows this his Aſſiduity.</p>
               <p>To which we may Object, that the Luſtre of a Princes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty confiſts not altogether in ſuch titular Diſtinctions; but in the Virtue, Integrity, Wiſdom, Gravity and Civil Reverence of his Miniſtry, which were yet more illuſtrated in the diſclaiming ſuch a Priviledge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prieſt</hi> in right of the protection of his Perſon, pleads the Dignity of his Function, as not ſubordinate to the <hi>Civil</hi>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:31280:34"/> 
                  <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> For diſpenſation to his Property: the ſanctified uſe thereof divided in the Inherence from the <hi>politick</hi> Body. This claim hath formerly been the ſubject of many violent and ſome tragick Conteſtations, licenſing the appeal of Prelates to Eccleſiaſtical Conclaves in matters of <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction: but ſince this uſage is at preſent of no force with us: we will not much inſiſt on the Diſcuſſion: only thus much we may thereon infer, that if in honor of their Function there ſhould be this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Reverence due unto their Perſon, or Reſervation to their Properties, it equitably muſt be under this Diſtinction; ſo long as they contain the Action of their Lives within the Limits of that Holy Exerciſe; and their Poſſeſſions thereto only Relative.</p>
               <p>The Publick <hi>Miniſter</hi> may ſeem to lay a more legitimate Title to ſuch Priviledge, inſomuch, as of neceſſity, his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is to be ſecluded (in a manner) from the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, to giue attendance ſoly in the moſt material Intereſts thereof: In which Agitation the Faculties of his minde are wholly ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſt, conveniently they cannot be relaxt, or yet diverted by a uſeful reflection on his own: yet in reſpect that ſuch immunity may ſeem to queſtion the integrity of the tranſactions of his private Commerce: whoſe Life ſhould ſo far be from all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Reproach, that it ſhould be exactly exemplary. His Inſtitution will be more agreeable and Injunctions valuable in their apprehenſions, to whoſe advantage he is deſign'd to Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, if therein equally concerned with the reſt. Nor can it be of uſe to him, ſo to be ſheltred from the Iſſue of the Law, whoſe proper Dignity ſpeaks him a Law unto himſelf, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unequal ſuffrage that lends Authority to any man to <hi>agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of Common Rights,</hi> who violates the Image thereof in his private Dealings.</p>
               <p>The Subjects ſecluded from the common courſe of Laws, in favour of their Incapacity, have a more rational claim to ſuch Priviledge, As a Wife, Children, and Servants, whoſe perſons in ſome caſes are diſpenced from the Penalty of publick Diſobedience, as ſubordinate Members to a more diſtinct Head, who only is reſponſable to the publick for their Miſcarriages, freed from the ingagements of their private Contracts, inſomuch as their Dependance is upon anothers Property, in their poſſeſſion only but in Truſt. Lunaticks and Ideots yet juſtly reach a vaſter Latitude of excluſion in their Acts (wholly divided from the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame) wanting the Faculty to diſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt Collateral implied in the Letter of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Ordinance, is the <hi>Injured,</hi> of whom moſt penal Statutes hold but ſmall account, regarding more perhaps the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of a publick Diſturbance, then of a private Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31280:35"/> To which Model the former Inſtitution of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeems altogether faſhioned, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth.</hi> This Law, though equal to the Treſpaſs, and ſevere to the Treſpaſſer, yet the ſence thereof explicitely not ſeems to bear the fulleſt extent of a perfect Ordinance, inſomuch as the chief Relative is not concern'd in the Contents thereof; regard here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in being only had unto the Offence, and Offender, <hi>An Eye for an Eye, and a Tooth for a Tooth.</hi> What Reparation hath the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured</hi> hereby, except that Eye or Tooth, which is the Penalty of the Offence, could be reſtored ſo to the defective Part, that Nature might aſſume the Exerciſe of her Faculty: But in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Treſpaſs where there was a more feiſable Reſtitution; <hi>The injured had a double Reparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The common neglect of this Rule in Right hath rendered the perſuit of Juſtice irkſome, in that her acceſs is more penible; then is her Iſſue ſatisfactory: ſo that moſt men (unleſs poſſeſſed with an inveterate Fury of Revenge) had rather (to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Oppreſſion) ſuffer ſilently, then for a ſmall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage procure unto themſelves a weightier Injury, or elſe (to the Diſturbance of the publick Peace) provok't, are thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unequal Repairers of their private wrongs. Which noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we may form more clearly to our obvious <hi>Miniſter:</hi> We for a cloſure to the Agitation of our preſent Subject, may gather from a clear perpenſation of our Argument, <hi>That a Law compos'd exactly equal, muſt hold a juſt proportion with the Nature of the offence, in reference both to the Publick and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt, extending the tenure of the Impoſition univerſally to every Civil Member of Capacity, with full and facile ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Injured.</hi>

               <p>Perhaps hereto may be alledg'd, that the Myſterie of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Rights may as plauſibly be reſtrained from the conception of the Vulgar, to the advantage of their Temporal Welfare, as thoſe are of Divine, to the advancement of their Spiritual; ſince they both meet in one Intention in the Reſtriction, which is to avoid the Damage, may enſue the ſiniſter expoſition of the Ignorant: It being a general frailty co-incident to humane Nature, o're partially to rely on the ſufficiency of his affected fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and had rather run the hazzard, may follow his Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then to betray his weakneſs in his doubts.</p>

                  <hi>Law.</hi> Words (in the moſt proper uſage taken) can figure but a ſhallow and an abſtruſe Character of the minde: ſo that the beſt digeſted method of delivery may probably (in the firſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) through ignorance or malice, unadviſedly or intentionally be prevaricated, more probably not ſtand ſo many Ages uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as would require a perfect <hi>Ordinance.</hi> The words <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi> in time, not only growing out of uſe, but alſo the proper Emphaſis of the <hi>Tongue:</hi> from whence perhaps are ſprung ſo many Controverſies in Courts of Judicature, and Schools, as hath made that Law and Learning was firſt uſeful and venerable, now become noxious and ridiculous; ſo that he is now accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as inſufficient an advocate, that cannot make a bad Cauſe good, by his <hi>Schicanrie,</hi> as he an illiterate Schollar, that cannot ſo diſguiſe a fallacy, as to make it appear true by his Sophiſtry, with how much damage to the people, and indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Majeſty of a <hi>Law.</hi> Such ſlights are ſheltered under the abſtruſeneſs of the <hi>ſenſe thereof,</hi> we leave every one to judge, believe, or Prove.</p>
               <p>Perhaps hereto may be objected, that the Nature of the <hi>Law</hi> ſo frequent is in uſe, the Virtue <hi>thereof</hi> cannot lie conceal'd, but daily is revived by ſome occular Proof.</p>
               <p>Omitting to inſert the hazzard of a <hi>Light</hi> educ't from ſuch Collation, in that the circumſtances rarely meet in a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we farther may reply, that ev'n in revolution of many Ages ſome <hi>Laws</hi> meet not with any accident ſo fully toucheth every clauſe therein,, as might render the iſſue fully clear: nor alſo any clauſe contain'd in every Law, doth clearly anſwer every accident, may poſſibly fall under the proper object of the ſame, as may appear in <hi>Moſes Appeal to the Almighty, for the deciſion of the claim of</hi> Zealophehad's <hi>Daughter in the common partage of the promis'd Land:</hi> In which regard, few <hi>Laws</hi> can be produc't, are ſo exactly conſtituted, that will not often want enlargement or enlightning.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laws in repugnance of their Nature</hi> tend yet more viſibly to the ſubverſion of <hi>their</hi> Inſtitution; the which at firſt inſpection may perhaps appear ſo groſs an abſurdity, as is hardly credited to be feiſable in the deliberate reſult of a rational conſultation. Yet when we ſhall more ſtrictly ſearch into the conſtitution of their parts, in reference to <hi>their</hi> proper uſe and ends, we ſhall finde, that not only in reſpect of one another, Laws often meet this Impropriety. But alſo (in relation to <hi>their</hi> proper pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes) prove ſometime contradictive to themſelves.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A Law is a preſcription, or a Rule impos'd by the Supream Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Nation, on every Member of Capacity, within the Limits of the Civil Union, to reſtrain each mans Actions from the Prejudice, and guide them to the mutual Benefit of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi> So that we may poſitively affirm, as reaſon is ſeated in the natural Body for the direction of the active Members to their proper uſe, and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> to the reſt: ſo the Law is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, as a due conduct to our private Rights, and common preſervation; neither can there be any proper diſtinction in their Faculties, both iſſuing from one ſource, and directed to one end: only Nature in that, form'd <hi>Her</hi> Juriſdiction in a ſmaller continent; which Policy in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a vaſter Latitude.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:31280:39"/> of a light to guide her <hi>Miniſtry. Policy</hi> muſt follow that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible light to the direction of <hi>Hers.

               <p>AS this <hi>Subject</hi> hath in regard of our Order, attained the preheminence of Poſition, ſo in Reſpect of her Nature, it requireth more eminence in Oppoſition: No Act can ſo much blemiſh the Dignity of a Civil Government as this (ſimply ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) in that it ſeemeth to uſurp the Authority of the Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, in aſſuming an impartial ſatisfaction to the diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will. The firſt Curſe Man incurr'd, was for his Diſobedience to his Creator, which in the Iſſue found an advantageous Cure. The ſecond Curſe befel Him, was for his <hi>Violence</hi> to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which Viſibly ne're met an Abſolution. God the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Eſſence of Juſtice, herein ſeems jealous of the Rights peculiar to his ſacred Miniſtry, reſerving only to himſelf this high prerogative, <hi>Vengeance is mine.</hi> Nor can the <hi>Law</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a blemiſh to this Image It repreſents) reſent the unjuſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment on her Rights herein with leſs ſeverity. But to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the degrees of this exorbitance inherent to <hi>Her</hi> Nature, it will be requiſite to viſit <hi>Her</hi> effects in the Diſtinction either of the <hi>Subject, Manner, Place,</hi> or <hi>Meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt <hi>Subject</hi> conſiderable, on whom a violence may be practiſed, is (according to the Rule of God and Nature) that which each man acts upon himſelf: The ground whereof is hardly evident to a moral ſence, which only meaſures the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the exteriour Actions, according to the damages ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by another, prefiguring, without ſuch Reference, each man might juſtly claim a priviledge in the diſpoſure only of his own: in which regard perhaps the <hi>Ethnicks</hi> have aſſumed ſo much Glory from this Enterpriſe, hereby, as they conceiv'd, triumphing o're the Malice of their Fate, though peradventure
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:31280:40"/> the Temerity might (more equitably according to their own Rules) merit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reproach of Lachety, then the applauſe of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, ſince ſo ignominious an Evaſion, betrayes not only the abjectneſs of the minde, but the infirmity of Nature, as well in the Anticipation of an evil, by an irrational Apprehenſion, as in the diſtruſt of our Faculties, to undergo the encounter. The exerciſe of Fortitude is oppoſition; not flight: But yet this Conſequence, if aſſented to, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally not reach the Nature of this Crime: we therefore muſt make uſe of higher ſpeculation to the Diſcovery. To aſcend thereto, if we ſhall make the firſt ſtep on the Baſe of Natures Rules, <hi>This Act</hi> will totally appear repugnant to her Order, <hi>Chaque Choſe ſuit ce que la deſtruit. Every thing doth flye that which would it deſtroy.</hi> If it infringe the Inſtitution of Nature then conſequently the firſt and moſt general Decree, that ever was impoſed by our Creator. If we look into the Letter of his Law, which may be thought more nighly to concern us. We ſhall finde the Intirnation <hi>hereof</hi> infolded in a general Inhibition, <hi>Not Kill,</hi> If we ſhall yet ſearch into the Nature of the <hi>Fact,</hi> by the Collation thereof to the preceding Actions of the Practiſers, we muſt conclude, that it will ſeldom be found other, then the iſſue of an irregular Life; wherein the all-ſupporting Influence of our Creators Grace ſeems totally retracted, as may appear in the prodigious Lives of <hi>Heliogabolus Caricola,</hi> and others: In oppoſition whereof, if we ſhall reflect on the Actions of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>Casſius,</hi> we may affirm, That <hi>Caeſars</hi> Murther (how fairly ſoever poliſht with pretence) ſo far eclipſt the Beauty of their former Virtues, they cannot win (in an impartial Judgement) ſo much credit to lend their Lives or Ends ſo much diſtinction from the reſt, as to give weight to an Objection. From ſacred Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, with more Authority perhaps, to theſe may alſo be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed <hi>Saul,</hi> only therein we meet with <hi>Rhaſis</hi> example, whoſe unblemiſh't life, and high approved end (though by himſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't) may caſt ſome ſcruple on our Argument: yet ſince this falleth under the Relation of an obſcure original. And under the Pattern of a tranſported Seale, we thereof not admit, as a fit ſubject to a farther diſcuſſion: only the life and end of <hi>Cato Uticenſis</hi> may afford a Proof without exception, where no Diſpleaſure ſprung from his proper Intereſt, found the leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in his Reſolution: but ſince the Actions of his Life had more refin'd Reſorts, then humane ſence can probably diſcloſe, ſoaring a pitch beyound the Practice of a Parallel: we will, in honour of the <hi>Object</hi> of his Paſſion, forbear to inſiſt on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
               <p>Yet if we ſhall perſue the inward trace of this Diſtemper more peculiarly, and pry more narrowly into the ſecret ſource there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:31280:40"/> we queſtionleſs ſhall finde it evident, that from the prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous Conjunction of repugnant Paſſions (Fear and Anger) iſſueth ſelf-diſlike.

               <p>To which may probably be objected, that a man may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time be reduced to that exigence, which probably may figure an authentick Summons.</p>
               <p>In reply whereto we may alledge, that ſuch extreams are not diſtinguiſhable to humane ſence, the Power and Providence of our Protector being unlimitable in the Meaſure, and inſcrutable in the Manner, <hi>Snatching Daniel from the Jaws of the hungry Lion, and</hi> Jonas <hi>from the entrails of the Whale.</hi> Nor is ſuch Grace diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, rarely or in favour only of his Prophets: as may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanc't in * a Grecian Captain's <hi>Delivery by a Fox from out the Entrails of the Earth, for dead, by his Enemies caſt in an Abiſs, from whence no humane Art nor Induſtry could have withdrawn him by a timely ſuccour.</hi>

               <p>Having diſclos'd the Nature of the Crime, we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to figure the eco a due penalty to the reſtraint thereof: But as a moral Inſpection could not attain the Myſtery of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo no moral Inſtitution can reach the manner of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; the Delinquent being hereby become impaſſable to <hi>Her</hi> Preſcription, remaining nothing inherent to his peculiar Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, whereon the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction can equitably be ſatisfied, but his Carkaſs and his Memory.</p>
               <p>The ſubject next material in reference to a violence is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Parent, without diſtinction, and not without a valid conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; there being not a more legitimate inherency to Rule, then that which is the immediate cauſe to our Production. And the more reverence owe we to <hi>his</hi> Dignity, in that our Creator deſcendeth to illuſtrate His Bounty to us, under <hi>this</hi> relation: In emulation whereof all Vertuous Princes have miſpriſed the moſt glorious Titles, in Competition with <hi>this</hi> high Attribute. To this moſt juſt Preheminence followeth ſo ſtrict an Injunction of Conformity, that the penalty of an Offence, ſhall violate this Right, but in a ſtubborn Refractory, or Indecent Oppoſition, was by the ſacred Law pronounced, Death: <hi>Who hath a rebellious Son, that will not obey the voice of his Father or Mother, nor be reform'd by their Correction, their Parents ſhall deliver him to the Civil Magiſtrate, who ſhall cauſe him to be ſtoned by the people.</hi> From which conſequence we may gather the Nature of that Crime by open or by ſecret practice, ſhall willingly attempt to reach at their deſtruction.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:31280:41"/>
               <p> In conſtituting Laws to the Reſtraint hereof, moſt Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have (in the primitive texture of their <hi>Civil</hi> Frame) been altogether negligent, either concluding, that nature had in ſuch Relation too powerful an influence in her Impreſſions, to want the aid of artificial Miniſtry, or elſe reflecting on the common frailty of our Nature, which took more violence from reſtraint, forbore to agitate on ſuch a Crime, as jealous to awake the faculty of Malice in ſuch Diſcuſſion: So ſilently for many years, paſt unexpreſt, becauſe unpractiſed, this <hi>Fact</hi> among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, till time, which lends Maturity to our Corruption, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't a Monſter in her horrid Pattern, which then gave Light to this Infliction, <hi>The Patracide was tyed cloſe in a Sack, and caſt into the Tyber.</hi> A penalty perhaps by them eſteem'd ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſevere, in that it figured not only a Diviſion of the Soul from her frail Manſion, but an extinction. Yet e're we ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to agitate on our Subject, we farther will examine the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Crime, in Reference to the other Members of a Family.</p>
               <p>Having diſcuſſed hereof in Relation to the Childrens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour to their Parents, we may inſiſt upon the Wifes unto the Husband; whom though the Myſtical Ceremony hath united in one Body, <hi>Affirming them to be but one Fleſh:</hi> yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſince <hi>Civil</hi> Rules have lent a difference of Dignity in the Diſtinction of Parts, moſt proper to the Conſtitution of their union. The nature of the Treſpaſs may poſſibly in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Husband meet a weightier Imputation, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Servants</hi> have a more ſubordinate Dependence on the Head of a Family, having from them their Livelihood, in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration only of their due ſubmiſſion to his Will. In contempt or repugnance whereof, if their demeanour ſhall proceed to act a <hi>Violence</hi> on his Perſon. The Crime more properly may be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with ſuch Diſtinction, and meet ſuch Puniſhment. In perſuit of our Order, ſhould here enſue a like Diſcuſſion on that <hi>Violence,</hi> the Maſter of the Family ſhould Act upon the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But ſince therein is found no legal Diſtinction in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Act, from what is practiſed on other Members of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, more then the Infamy which juſtly followeth the Breaches of ſo nigh Relations. We will remit to treat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our Reflection of the <hi>Manner</hi> and the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of a <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe ſucceeds in Eminence of Diſtinction (in Reference to a <hi>Violence)</hi> the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> (under what degree ſoever being in Execution of his Miniſtry) in that, therein <hi>he</hi> fully ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the <hi>Civil</hi> power, and conſequenly the <hi>Violence</hi> ſo ſuſtained, more highly ought to be reſented by the Juriſdiction
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31280:41"/> to whom he doth officiate, as a contempt or Oppoſition to her Order: In which reſpect perhaps, this Fact (on Him) extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a higher Conſequence (then on the former Subjects) might juſtly claim precedence in our Order, to all thoſe our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited Diſtinctions, had not <hi>Policy</hi> ſucceeded unto Natures Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, both in her Pattern and Eſtabliſhment. All other Perſons of what Degree or Quality ſoever, Noble or Ignoble, Alien or Deniſon, in Reference to his Treſpaſs fall in the Ballance of one common Eſtimate. The <hi>manner</hi> how this Treſpaſs may be acted, well conſidered, will vary much the Nature of the Crime, lending there to more weight or leſs from whence the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty receives due Regulation. The common differences where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may viſibly be reduc't to theſe Diſtinctions, <hi>Encounters, Duels, Surpriſes,</hi> in the firſt Principle. The intention of the Agent (which ſoly lends material Conſequence to the Fact) ſeems wholly diſengaged. In the <hi>Second,</hi> the intent of both ſeems clearly pre-ingaged. In the <hi>Third,</hi> the intent of only one ſeems pre-poſſeſt.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Encounters</hi> admit of a double Diſtinction, being ſuch as are meerly <hi>Caſual,</hi> having no farther motive then the preſent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident or <hi>Collateral,</hi> having Relation to ſome former Difference; yet ſo as neither Time nor place were pre-adviſed of either: If pre-adviſed of Both (as oftentimes is practiſed, to ſhun the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ſeverity of the Law, diſguiſing ſo the Action) then falls the Nature of this Treſpaſs under the Diſtinction of a <hi>Duel.</hi> If but of one determined, the Fact may properly be tearmed a <hi>Surpriſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſual Encounters,</hi> what e're the Iſſues thereof are, have the moſt ſpecious pretence to plead for their Indulgence; in that the firſt motive of the incenſed will is not oft-times within the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Command of the moſt regular minde, which herein but inform'd by unconſulted Appearance may facily ſeduce the Judgment to proſecute the ſenſe: yet ſince no Imperfection how naturally ſoever inherent to our frail Condition (within the true Capacity of our <hi>Civil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion)</hi> can plead a priviledge to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice Another. Nor perfection (how ſupernaturally ſoever in any conſtituted) while yet a Member of this <hi>Civil</hi> Frame) can lend a juſt Authority to any, to be Repairer of their proper Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; as appears in the example of our perfect'ſt Guide, In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence only of true Innocence. <hi>Put up thy Sword, who taketh the Sword. ſhall periſh with the Sword.</hi> Nor can we, how juſtly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever commenced or proſecuted, exempt ſuch Procedure from the Nature of a Treſpaſs: yet under this Limitation, ſuch only to the Publick. The private therein totally excluded, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the Nature of the ſtrife implyes an equal Oppoſition, if not in Power, in Will, and ſelf-opinion of Sufficiency, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31280:42"/> if he be foll'd; he juſtly payes the forfeit to his own Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, who elſe declining the attempts, might legally have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu'd the Advantage of his Injury, without conteſting for an equal ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>To which may poſſibly be alledg'd, that the <hi>firſt,</hi> moſt <hi>juſt</hi> and impulſive Law of Nature prompts every living Creature, (for their proper ſafety) to riſe in Oppoſition in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Nor is he half ſecur'd that relies only on the paſſive Part.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the objection we reply, the Law requireth but a viſible declining from the Action, to acquit him of the event thereon enſues: To which, although perhaps <hi>It</hi> ſeems to have preſcrib'd too vaſt a Latitude, as <hi>to retreat until he can Retire no farther:</hi> in which he probably may be ſlain e're he attains thoſe Bounds. Yet other Circumſtances that may reach the Intention of the Law therein, in Reaſon may acquit him unleſs the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing judge preſume too much on his Authority to tye his Cenſure ſoly to the ſtrictneſs of the <hi>Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The treſpaſs may hereon enſue unto the publick, is either in Reſpect of the Common Diſturbance, <hi>Breach of Peace;</hi> or in Regard of the loſs of a <hi>Subject, Man-ſlaughter.</hi> To <hi>that</hi> our Law hath equitably impoſed Impriſonment or Fine. To this a total forfeiture of their <hi>Goods.</hi> Yet more effectually to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint hereof might poſſibly ſucceed the Influence of ſeverer Laws, directed to ſuppreſs ſuch Incivilities, as commonly are the Ground to ſuch Diſorders, in which moſt Civil Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem totally defective.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Collater al Encounters,</hi> by our Laws, are not diſtinguiſhable from poſitive <hi>Duels,</hi> though herein Time or Place concur not with the motive in the Intention. In that the Reference of a former Breach prefigures a Deſign to perſue the event to which Occaſion then adminiſters, remaining ſtill an unremitting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity betwixt the efficient and the effect. Yet when we ſhall reflect on the Infirmity of humane Nature, which in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect'ſt Temper not alwayes is provided with ſufficient Aids to check the ſuddain Motives of the Senſe; but having often paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſuſtained the Indignity of the extreameſt out rages, may ſometime be provok't to yield unto a leſs, the Spirits pre-diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſenſibly attracting the Flame, was formerly to them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, leaving no intermiſſion for Diſcourſe to agitate on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the tranſported will: as alſo frequency in Injury may poſſibly proceed to an irreſiſtable Importunity: And in an Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Solicitation, exact that our will aſſents not to, <hi>Potentia motata fit far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31280:42"/> from a clear Perpenſation of our Argument, may really be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſo viſible a difference between this manner of ſtrife, and pre-deſigned Conflicts, as may equitably lend a more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Diſtinction to the Penalty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duels</hi> may properly be extended unto theſe Diſtinctions, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajuſticial, Juſticial,</hi> and <hi>Private.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Extrajuſticial Duels</hi> are ſuch as are Authorized by mutual Aſſent of two hoſtile Nations for preheminence in Honour, for the Deciſion of pretended Rights, to avoid in future, the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of more Blood, and other general Calamities too incident to War, though otherwayes ſucceſsful: ſo were declined the Diviſions between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> by <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah.</hi> So concluded the Conteſtation between the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans and the Albans: by the <hi>Heratii,</hi> and the <hi>Curatii:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the latter manner of Conflict may ſeem rather to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Nature of a <hi>Skirmidge</hi> then a <hi>Duel;</hi> which taken in the ſtricteſt ſence, implyeth only ſingle oppoſitions. Theſe manner of Conflicts are ſo far removed from the ſubordinate ſuppreſſion of a <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction.

               <p>
                  <hi>Private Duels,</hi> taken in the ſtricteſt ſence, are only ſingle Combats, in Weapon time and place determinable, ſprung from no other ground then ſence of Injury, nor proſecute other object then Revenge, though Both oft-times ſeem meaſur'd by the reſentment of ſome others, more then by our own: Vanity the litigious pretender to Honour, muſt court her looſer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (vulgar Opinion) to attain his Proſtitute. A ridiculous Motive to an arrogant Aſſumption, pretending both to Right and Power to arbitrate and to Execute in our proper Intereſts, in Contempt or Miſpriſion of the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction: ſo that we may conclude, according to the Event, the Treſpaſs is from Others of this Nature, but diſtinguiſhable in an oſtentive At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, whether the extent hereof may poſſibly reach the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Murder, perhaps, in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules, may be diſputable. In that the Intent, which ſoly is effectual to qualifie the Fact with ſuch Diſtinction, ſeems fully prepoſſeſt to uſe the uttermoſt Ability to take away anothers Life: yet, in Reſpect, the perſuit is with equal hazzard of our own, meeting like purpoſe in the Oppoſition, ſuch Attribute <hi>Hereto</hi> too ſtrictly ſeems implyed, though not by Law for ſuch too ſtrictly puniſhed: Firſt, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as in ſuch Procedure, the injured ſeems to uſurp the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction, in perſuit of his own unequal ſatisfaction, as alſo, in that the Tragick Iſſues of ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts often do engage ſucceeding Families, to their Inemnities thereon ſprung, in like Oppoſitions. Furthermore, in that ſuch Action paſſing with Impunity, may ſeem (i'th vulgar Voice) to conſtitute that Glory on a Crime, which ſoly ſhould be proper to a vertuous Enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>One Controverſie, inherent to our <hi>Subject,</hi> yet reſts undiſcuſt, whether the <hi>Seconds</hi> (acting no farther then to ſecure the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> from indirect Advantages, or treacherous practiſes may equitably be attainted by the Law, as Accezoir, or Complice to the Fact. In ſolution whereof, we may reply, That ſince the <hi>Seconds</hi> were privy to the Intention of the Principles, which they had power to fruſtrate by Information of the <hi>Civil</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, they, as Collaterals, may be accounted guilty of the event, in favouring ſo their purpoſes.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Surpriſes</hi> (to moderate or extend their Nature) may be indu'd with theſe Diſtinctions, <hi>Eſſential, Definitive,</hi> or <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Eſſential Surpriſes</hi> are ſuch, as e're they are educed into Act, are formed pre-adviſedly in the intention of the Agent, beyond the Notion of his Adverſary; ſo that we properly may tearm the Fact a treacherous Aſſault, with Weapon undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable, be it Sword, Fire, or Poyſon. This is without
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31280:43"/> contradiction, the higheſt and moſt damagable kinde of <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> inſomuch, as it leaveth none the ſmalleſt ſhadow of a viſible ſecurity. The ſtrongeſt hereby <hi>becomes deprived of his</hi> ſtrength, and the warieſt of his Caution. Nor can the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking meet a Cauſe, or Circumſtance, might mittigate the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Crime. Amaſa's <hi>open Hoſtility with</hi> Joab, <hi>could not render the Fact pardonable in his Judgement, for whoſe Intereſt and Advantage it was finiſhed.</hi> Nor can <hi>Parmenio</hi>'s Treaſon, the <hi>Guiſes</hi> Indirect Ambition, or <hi>D'Ancre's</hi> Inſolence excuſe thoſe Princes, who to avoid the caſualty of their redoubted Power, have ſecretly and indirectly ſo contriv'd their Ruine: The courſe of Juſtice either muſt be proſecuted, or oppos'd, to form her Execution warrantable. If the <hi>firſt</hi> could not be perſued with the publick Safety, the <hi>latter</hi> might be proved but with private Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: Who ſubmit not unto the empty Summons of a juſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, may be concluded guilty, without a farther Depoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Definitive Surpriſes</hi> are ſuch, which were not formed former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Intention, but on a preſent Injury reſented, perſueth ſuch unequal Advantages, either in Reſpect of <hi>Perſon, Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>Number,</hi> as are no way reſiſtable. The <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> in Reference to the former, can legally attain no valuable Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction: inſomuch as the irregular will can figure for pretence no motive herein to perſue the Fact, but Malice, nor object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but ſimply Anothers Deſtruction, our proper ſafety not in Competition. Nor hath the aſſailed Faculty to avoid the Iſſue of ſuch <hi>Violence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Relative ſurpriſes</hi> are ſuch, wherein the Treſpaſſer, through Negligence or Preſumption, obliquely only is concern'd, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under his Tuition, Guard, or Cuſtody, the Subject, Beaſt, or Perſon, through diſtemper prone to act a <hi>Violence.</hi> This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wilful <hi>Violence Moſes</hi> reflected on, though poſſibly not in ſo large extent, as totally might concern the Nature of ſuch Accidents: Yet ſufficiently to lend a perfect Rule to form an Ordinance unto the equal Proſecution of any in this Nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſt. <hi>If an Oxe ſhall gore a man that he dye, the owner or keeper thereof being formerly advertiſed of ſuch a diſpoſition in the Beaſt, the Penalty of the Treſpaſs ſhall be the forfeiture of his Life: but ſo, That for a certain ſum of Money, as a Fine, his Life ſhall be redeemable.</hi> The ground hereof is evident, being in regard the owner had capacity to have reſtrained them from ſuch an Execution. To which, common humanity ought to have been a competent Injunction. Forewarned of the Danger of the Accident; but being altogether careleſs of the common ſafety, ſuch Neglect or Preſumption, might really be ſuſpected to have had a reſerv'd Object of ſome ſecret malice; to which in right, his life could only ſatisfie; yet in reſpect ſuch Beaſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31280:44"/> or Perſon, poſſibly, might eſcape from the Endeavours of the warieſt Guard, a fine might juſtly ballance ſuch incircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection.</p>
               <p>The Reference of an intentional Inſtigation to a violence, might orderly ſeem reduced under this Diſtinction: but ſince ſuch Procedure falls under common Notion of a Principle, we ſhould too far ſwerve from the poſitive Rule of <hi>Right,</hi> to lend them here but a Relation to the Fact, another executes by their direction: the nature whereof more properly is compriſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Diſtinction of the <hi>Eſſential.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Place</hi> wherein a <hi>wilful Violence</hi> becomes acted may alſo ſeem to qualifie the Nature of the Treſpaſs, with Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to aggravate or leſſen the exorbitance: In Reference where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we will reflect on theſe Particulars, <hi>The Temple, The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Reſidence,</hi> or <hi>Court of Judicature,</hi> each <hi>Mans Peculiar Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.

               <p>
                  <hi>The Temple</hi> hath in former Ages been held in ſo high Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among divers Sects and Nations, that the <hi>Civil Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> hath ſometime caſt reſtraint on her own <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Delinquents, taking their Sanctuary within the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ſacred circumſcription. If this high Priviledge were thereto conſtituted on an authentick Ground, how conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a Motive will it be to induce the <hi>Civil Miniſtry</hi> ſeverely to endeavour to ſecure this place from private out rages. A <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> there ſeems more immediately perpetrated in the preſence of that high Judge, who ſoly to himſelf reſerveth Vindication, and conſequently denotes a great Inſolence in Contempt of his Ordinance. The high reſentment whereof he ſeems himſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly to infer in his terrible Threats againſt the rebellious Jews deducing the vaſt Latitude of their Crimes ſhould meet his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance <hi>From the Blood of</hi> Zachariah, <hi>who was ſlain between the Temple-Porch and the Altar.</hi> Farthermore, this <hi>Place,</hi> erected more peculiarly to perfect and confirm our common union. Such Procedure there practiſed ſeems to ſtrike at the very Nature of the Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Private Diviſions breaking into Actions of Hoſtility within the <hi>Princes Reſidence</hi> or Court of Judicature, highly exalt the Nature of Commotions: For that in ſuch Timerity, the Agents ſeem totally to caſt off the Impoſition of the <hi>Civil Juriſdiction,</hi> violating ſo preſumptuouſly the <hi>Ordinances</hi> thereof, under the immediate notion of her <hi>Miniſters,</hi> which properly might ſeem to figure an open Inſurrection againſt the <hi>Civil Power.</hi>

               <p>3. <hi>Alimentary Proviſions</hi> in their improper Aſſimulation too frequently prove prejudicial to the natural Welfare of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame; which noxious.

The <hi>proper Corruption</hi> of our Nutritive Proviſions follow moſt commonly the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the unſeaſonable collection of the Fruits of the Earth, or the too long ſuſpenſion from their uſe. So Corn becomes Muſty, Fruits mouldy, Fleſh tainted: The ſeveral uſe whereof, ſo qualified, produceth oft not only private Indiſpoſitions in our humane Nature, but general and Epidemical Mortalities.</p>
               <p>Having diſtinguiſhed the Nature of theſe Impediments to our common welfare, we ſhould thereto perſue a Remedy which, meeting in each particular ſeveral Objects (the Original Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption to be avoided, the Accidental rectified.

               <p>
                  <hi>Adventitious</hi> is that; which is communicated by Society or Vicinity of Perſon, or Subject Infected: It ſometime alſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth more remotely in Affinities of Blood, by ſecret ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of their Conſtitutions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Native</hi> is that, which is originally attracted in our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immediately from the Infirmity of our Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adventitious</hi> meets prevention in the <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty either by Reſtraint of <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Community;</hi> or by a publick Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Artificial Remedies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſtraint of Commerce;</hi> with all infected Places (how remotely diſtant ſoever) is evidently neceſſary to the Preſervation of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame from this Calamity: inſomuch, as there are few Materials vendible, in which the Infection may not poſſibly be transferred to another Nation, after a long ceſſation of the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Reſtraint of Community</hi> ſhould be neceſſary to the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this common Miſery, appeareth evidently in the

               <p>The Nature of this Reſtraint extends to two Diſtinctions, either <hi>Excluſive,</hi> or <hi>Incluſive.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>From the general Reſult of our Argument, may viſibly be collected three diſtinct <hi>Principles</hi> neceſſary in Practice againſt the Approaches of this Miſery, <hi>Induſtry, Providence, Charity;</hi> which perſue alſo three diſtinct Objects to attain the perfect uſe to which they were directed. <hi>Induſtry</hi> acquireth, <hi>Providence</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth, <hi>Charity</hi> diſpenceth: On which three columns, we will erect the Fabrick of our <hi>Civil</hi> Magazine. To appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate which exactly to the uſe, we will reflect on the extent thereof, which may be limited in this Diſtinction, <hi>Publick,</hi> or <hi>Private.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Publick</hi> uſe hath for Object common neceſſity; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereof, although perhaps extended to many particulars, in Reference to our livelihood; yet pertinently may be reduc't unto the Intimation of one common ſubject, under the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Grain;</hi> which ſoly being ſufficient to the ſupport of our natural <hi>Life,</hi> all other Aliments ſeem therein properly included. <hi>This</hi> common Calamity (in the Defect <hi>thereof)</hi> moſt frequently is induced by the ſtubborn perſuit of our Original Corruption, <hi>Which cauſeth the Earth to be as Iron, and the Heavens as Braſs.</hi> Such was <hi>Jewries miſery under</hi> Eliſha<hi>'s Prophetick Miniſtry, ſuch Egypts, under</hi> Joſeph<hi>'s Delivery.</hi> And though the efficient cauſe of this Diſaſter may ſeem to be of a far higher Nature, then yet a <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty could e're pretend to reach at the Removal in a timely Remedy: yet ſince Divine Providence hath ſo far fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd humane Prudence, as to avoid the fury of the Iſſue, we plauſibly may follow the example of ſuch Practiſes, which though often grounded on a ſupernatural Provoyance, yet have they in their <hi>Civil</hi> Order left an uſeful Preſcription. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miniſtry under <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Truſt, was to erect vaſt <hi>Granaries</hi> in every part, ſucceſſively accumulated from the ſuperfluous Affluence of the common Plenty. In proſecution of the order of this Rule may probably be objected, that he had happier Aids to lend ſucceſs to his Intention, then humane Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alwayes is aſſured of, <hi>A remote Prevoyance,</hi> and <hi>a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Plenty.</hi>

               <p>In Relation to the <hi>latter</hi> may be inferrr'd, the Faculty of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth rarely want ſuch ſupream meaſure of Celeſtial Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to educe a fertility; where Induſtry hath in her form'd a perfect Diſpoſition by a proper Culture.</p>

                  <hi>Exportive Commerce</hi> of this Commodity (except on ſpecial Licence from the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry) might totally be interdcted.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Diſorder</hi> alſo frequently may prove an Introduction to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Scarcity;</hi> which following uſually the inſolence of Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Armies, the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry only can remit the regulation thereof to the vigilance of the Military, if over It remain <hi>there</hi> to ſuch Influence.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>Private</hi> uſe exacts for Object only a peculiar Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which uſually is induc't by theſe particulars, <hi>Vacancy, Impotence, Caſual</hi> or <hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntary Vacancy</hi> meeting this miſery, as a juſt Penalty, might ſeem but too indulgently treated by the <hi>Civil Miniſtry,</hi> to be but only viſited for Relief, were not the publick welfare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently therein concern'd, either in the loſs of a uſeful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Faculty, or in the ſufferance of a uſeleſs and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Burden; to avoid the Dammage or Incumbrance of ſuch ſuperfluous Mixtures; The <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry can only ſafely imitate the Practice of the Phyſical; <hi>Aut corrigendo, aut ejiciendo, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Correcting or Ejecting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The perfect'ſt method of Correction is that, moſt probably may reduce them to a juſt Devoir, which properly may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the due Impoſition of a penal Task, if which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not attain the intention of the Inſtitution, ſuch incorrigible Incapacity may equitably deſerve an infamous Ejection from our <hi>Civil</hi> Union in a preſcribed Exile.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Impulſive Vacancy</hi> encountring Indigence, merits a more debonair Redreſs, and nicer Circumſpection from the <hi>Civil</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to educe obſtructed Inclination into uſeful Action; not only in Compaſſion to an undeſerv'd Diſtreſs, but alſo in reſpect their ſuffering may be adjudg'd a dangerous ſymptome of the Failing Faculties of the <hi>Civil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> The intercourſe whereof can as ſeldom ſuffer Intermiſſion or Ceſſation, as the Natural, without the hazzard of Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>To form a Remedy to this ſuſpenſion, it would be requiſite, a publick mannage were inherent to the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame (as <hi>Davids</hi> Rural Oeconomies, or <hi>Solomons</hi> Naval Commerce) to which all the neceſſitous vacant might freely have recourſe for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31280:51"/> at a ſubvalid Rate, from whence they might have Licenſe to retire, when they could finde occaſion better to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their Induſtry, which Inſtitution happily might meet other Important uſes to enlarge the welfare of the <hi>Common Union,</hi> not pertinent to appropriate to our preſent Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Impotence</hi> of <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty in Members of the Body <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick,</hi> can only reach to theſe particulars, <hi>Infants, Aged,</hi> and the <hi>Infirm.</hi>

                  <hi>Infants</hi> abandon'd to the Caſualty of their Exiſtence, may juſtly from the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry, claim the exacteſt tender of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in that they are indu'd with a potential Aptitude to make a Reparation of the Breaches, which the <hi>Civil</hi> Body daily ſuffers in the Infirmity of Nature, rendring the Conſtitution thereof in ſuch ſucceſſive Springs, an everlaſting Exiſtence; under what Limitation of time we ſhould denote this <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity, can not more properly be expreſt, then in the <hi>Naturaliſts</hi> Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their order: Foraſmuch as after ſeven years tearm they are (according to the Practice of divers Commonwealths) ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a <hi>Civil</hi> Introduction to attain their Livelihood.

               <p>2. As the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry ſhould reflect on the Indegence of <hi>Infants,</hi> in reſpect of what they may be; ſo on the neceſſity of the <hi>Aged,</hi> in reference to what they have been; which yielding a more viſible Proof, may direct us to a more proportionable Diſtinction in the inſtitution of their ſuccor, ſome have exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their proper ſtore in the relief of others Miſeries.

The Dignity of the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry is engaged, not to permit their Induſtry to paſs rewarded only in their precedent exiſtence, both in reſpect their poverty may be a mark of their Integrity, as alſo ſuch neglect may probably prove a Motive un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to others, to proſecute the publick Intereſts leſs aſſiduouſly and faithfully: to which natural defect cannot be iſſued a more timely ſuccour, and with leſs charge unto the Commonwealth, then to admit a ſubſtitute to his Office, under ſatisfaction only in future, to ſucceed to the imployment: the benefit thereof to be tranſacted ſoly to the uſe of the declined Officer.</p>
               <p>If their endeavours were directed only to the Advancement of a private Intereſt, thoſe Relations (whither Natural or <hi>Civil)</hi> ought mutually to contribute to their ſuccour: but ſince no ſuch voluntary conducement can be expected from the degenerate Inclination of Blood, or Ingratitude of man ſo generaly in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.

Whence hereto equitably ſhould be deriv'd a ſuccor, exacts a vaſt extent in the Diſtinction of the Accidents.

If under a voluntary ſuccour of another, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance is Reciprocal: If under none of theſe Diſtinctions fall the Accident, the Natural Relations are engaged next to the ſupport. If thoſe are not endued with a capacity thereto, their ſafeguard only reſteth in the publick Succour.</p>
               <p>Who are reduced into Indigence by a <hi>Caſual Dammage,</hi> be it Fire, Inundation, Tempeſt, War, or the like publick Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more equitably may repair, for their ſupport, unto the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry: Inſomuch, as it only falls under the Capacity and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31280:52"/> Devoyr thereof to avoid ſuch Accidents by a timely Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. Nor can a more equal Redreſs thereto be inſtituted (ſince every one may therein be concern'd) then by a General Collection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>unjuſtly Dammaged</hi> to this extremity may ſeem to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a Subject more properly inherent to the Deciſion of <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, then charitable Aids: Yet inſomuch as ſome have not Capacity timely to proſecute Legal Rights to the Advantage of their Future Intereſts; either by reaſon of the Immaturity of their Years, Defect of Natural Light; or ſtrict ſubordinance to nigh Relations, eſpecially therein concern'd. The <hi>Civil</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry might impoſe the Circumſpection and Tuition of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts upon the next Relation of Capacity to agitate therein, under the penalty of their ſupport, whoſe Right had failed in their Negligence. This may appear, at firſt Inſpection, but an inconſiderable Caution, to preſerve the Members of a <hi>Civil</hi> Union from this Calamity: Yet when we ſhall more ſeriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the numerous failing of Succeſſions, Breaches of Truſt, and voluntary Reverſions of Contracts of Marriage (the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Principles to the ſupport of Families) through the irregular Expence of careleſs Parentage, we rationally may conclude that <hi>this</hi> Particular requires more Circumſpection from the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Miniſtry (in reſpect of the Multitudes therein concern'd) then all the reſt we have inſiſted on. Nor can a more proper ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute be thereto inſtituted, then who may probably be intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Conſequence: provided that the <hi>Civil</hi> Miniſtry be readily aſſiſtant to their Remonſtrances.</p>

Whither it were neceſſary to the uſe, to include each Sex in

               <p>
                  <hi>The Drunk.</hi> In the Intimation of this Exception, we only do imply the preſent State of <hi>this</hi> Diſorder: not but perhaps Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom may therein probably attain to ſuch a Habit, as might be requiſite to admit of an Intermiſſive, or a General Excluſion. In Reference to our Poſition the Carthaginians form'd this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Not to exceed in Wine that night deſign'd for Procreation.</hi> In Reſpect the exceſs hereof not only perturbs the Spirits, chiefly officiate to the Operation.

               <p>3.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vigilance,</hi> In regard ſuch Habit endueth us with Capacity to anticipate all Occaſions, may conduce unto our Purpoſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the tearm of Life loſt in a ſluggiſh Stupidity, and lendeth more Facility to the Proſecution of an enterpriſe: Nor is this ſeaſon of purility only material to this Regulation, as moſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Induction of any Form; but as moſt incident and propenſive to yield the Indulgences of floth, moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then accompanying the o're humid Temperature of the Brain. Which exerciſe we have qualified with <hi>Chearfulneſs,</hi> leſt the ſeverity of ſuch a Caution ſhould become to yet unactive Spirits a diſagreeing Burden, ſo render them leſs uſeful, fetter'd with ſuch Anxiety: On which Conſideration, was perhaps grounded the Prudence of thoſe Parents, who have been ſo exactly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in Education of their Children, to have their Spirits,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:31280:54"/> (with the new born day) ſummoned ſoftly from their flattering ſlumbers by the inticing notes of Harmony.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Travel,</hi> Inſomuch as by aſſiduous Exerciſe, the Body by degrees becomes both ſtrengthned and inured to encounter Actively or Paſſively, all Oppoſitions peculiar to our Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or accidental to our Fortunes. The conſtitution of our Body becomes hereby improved, and our Health ſecur'd, The Spirits hereby alſo will become more pure and vigorous to the Exerciſe of the minde, To which Practice we have annexed this <hi>Coherent,</hi> that our labours be not ſo remiſly proſecuted, as they might ſuddenly become rebutable, but that they might inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly extend unto the time prefixed to the uſe, without Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to the undertaker, either by entertaining the minde with variety of Objects, or with the Recompence and Glory of the Iſſue.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Moral Civility,</hi> This Qualification extends It ſelf to many excellent uſes, perhaps beyond the full Preſcription of our preſent Obſervation, or the juſt Capacity of our <hi>Treatiſe.</hi> Firſt it layes an exact Foundation for <hi>Civil</hi> Rule to erect her Fabrick on, forming the minde to a gentle and ſubmiſſive <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> whereon was conſtituted the <hi>Spartan</hi> Glory.

It appeaſes the fury of an Adverſary, and wins our Inclination e're we conſult our will. It is the very band of common Union, and the eſtabliſher of Peace. Reproof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with this Ornament, is an effectual Balm, and the moſt ſtrict ſubjection ſtill agreeable: Nor yet becomes the Influence of this <hi>Vertue</hi> limited within the Notions of her proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but poliſheth the minde to the more apt Reception of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Myſteries.

               <p>4. <hi>National Affection,</hi> Of all the endowments, may, in our frail Conjecture, tend to the exact compoſure of a well form'd minde. No one, in humane Reaſon, can be ſo requiſite to the Eſtabliſhment of a <hi>Civil</hi> Felicity, as <hi>This</hi> entirely conſtituted in every part of a <hi>Community.</hi> All other Vertues may have ſecret Sources, and Improper Objects, not conſiſtent, perhaps, with their true Eſſences, but in form, adhering only to peculiar In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. This only is the proper teſt to all their Attributes,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:31280:55"/> moſt Hiſtories being pregnant in Authentick Proofs, That Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues faireſt Ornaments have frequently, not only attempted, but therein ſucceeded, nay materially conduced to the ſubverſion of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. The firſt and moſt viſible ſtep to all the antick <hi>Roman Glory,</hi> and enſuing <hi>Greatneſs</hi> was formed from the ſecret influence of this their inuate Luſtre, and in decline there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Both</hi> terminated.

               <p>Our rugged Nature thus poliſhed and prepared to the Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of a more excellent Capacity. We will proceed to the Remonſtrance of thoſe Objects, we purpoſe to direct them to, as moſt material to the <hi>Civil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> which properly may be compriſed in theſe enſuing Principles, <hi>Letters, Arms, Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>Manufacture:</hi> Theſe being the only Columns that ſupport a <hi>Civil Fabrick,</hi> though ſeveral uſeful Branches hence deriv'd, may poſſibly, at firſt Inſpection, ſeem to participate a more diſtinct Nature in their Conſequence.</p>

               <p>To avoid therefore this Error in <hi>Their</hi> Nature, and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient in the manner of <hi>Their</hi> Acquiſition, we will confine <hi>Them</hi> only to <hi>Their</hi> proper uſe, and preſcribe to their exerciſe ſuch Objects only, as are material to the <hi>Civil</hi> welfare.

               <p>The Objects of <hi>Learning</hi> eſpecially conduce unto the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> welfare, muſt of neceſſity either have Reference to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation and Improvement of the Minde, Body, or Eſtate: To Illuminate, Rectifie, and Guide the Intellect, <hi>Letters</hi> preſents us thoſe two uſeful Pieces of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Moral Philoſophy.</hi> To repair the Breaches of our Infirm Nature, <hi>Phyſick,</hi> with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendences thereon.

               <p>Theſe Ornaments of <hi>Civil</hi> Diſtinction may probably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a Vain, Ridiculous and but an empty Gratuity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming the Majeſty and Magnificence of a Prince, or State; not accompanied with more eſſential Inherences: Yet rightly conferr'd, they are but Ceremonious Pledges of the enſuing Neceſſity to enlarge their <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty in future Employment to the publick Benefit: Notwithſtanding <hi>They</hi> may poſſibly meet in ſuch a Subject, whoſe Indigence might exact more timely and material Gratuity, elſe ſuch intended Grace might prove to them both Burdenſome and Reproachful: which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient might happily be ſupplied from the Common Treaſury in ſome Annual Penſion. Provided, that neither the Proportion nor Continuance thereof, had other Reference then the due ſupport of that Dignity conferr'd, until ſome Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent might form an Opportunity to tranſact like Advantage on them in ſome uſeful Miniſtry moſt proper to ſo eminent a Capacity. Otherwiſe, if ſuch Munificence were more Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or unlimited, The Treaſury would either thereby become ſo burdened, or exhauſted by the continual Affluence of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders, that either new Sources thereto muſt be derived from the Subjects by a general Levy of Impoſitions, to the publick Prejudice, or elſe the Majeſty of a Prince or State become eclipſt through Penury and Want.</p>
               <p>Under the Intimation of <hi>Civil</hi> Offices to the <hi>Publick</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the ſimple <hi>Latitude</hi> preſcribed to our Charge, may be compriſed the Council or Advice, that with undaunted Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity makes either Propoſition or Oppoſition againſt the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, Deſigns, or Practiſes of a Prince or Populace to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of a Common Good, or the Declining of a <hi>Publick</hi> Damage: though to the hazzard of Eſtate, Liberty; or Life.
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:31280:60"/> Such was <hi>Regulus</hi> Advertiſement to the <hi>Senate, When they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to conclude a ſhameful Peace with their inſulting Enemies in favour only of his Safety, become their enlarged Interceſſor, on his Faith, failing thereof to return:</hi> which reſolute Perſeverance in a Publick Convention, may ſometime poſſibly paſs under Cenſure of an incautious or corrupt Obſtinacy, that with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity in form tendeth but to foment inteſtine Faction. But the Grounds Inherence, and Conſequence of ſuch Debates ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, will evidently diſcloſe the Nature of the Intention: The <hi>Former</hi> uſually proceedeth with more Modeſty and Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The <hi>Latter</hi> with more inſolence and Paſſion. <hi>That</hi> but endeavours to enform or to enlighten his Pretences to an equal Reception: <hi>This</hi> to impower them to a ſervile Impoſition. In private Conventions ſuch Procedure may ſeem but to decline that Intereſt for which peculiarly the Members thereof were united. Yet rightly underſtood, it may become a <hi>Paradox</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that Prince or State can be endued with Capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any real Advantage involved in a <hi>Publick</hi> Prejudice, or disjoyn'd from a <hi>Publick</hi> Benefit; though ſuch a Notion hath unhappily paſſed for a general Poſition. Whereby, Princes too frequently reſent with high Indignity Repugnance to their will, corrupted by the Adulation of adulterate Gloſſes: But a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent inſpection will from enſuing Conſequents ſoon collect the Error of their Apprehenſion: And Honor that Integrity, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventureth rather to incur the hazzard of his Princes Favour, then wilfully to betray his Maſters Intereſts. Such a reſentment was plauſibly expreſt by one of our illuſtrious Princes, <hi>Whoſe youthful Licentiouſneſs (during his Fathers Reign) being gravely checked by a Civil Magiſtrate, proceeded to that heighth to ſtrike him; for which, he being by the Magiſtrate committed, He after for ſuch Procedure, was by him (ſucceeding to his Fathers Throne) moſt highly dignified, acknowledging he worthily had therein main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Dignity of his Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. By Inference of a <hi>Natural</hi> Beneficence, we may imply ſuch genuine Diſcoveries of Natures Myſteries, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce unto the ſafety or Felicity of the <hi>Civil</hi> Union, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Avarice or Envy of others had concealed, or their own Induſtry or Experience hath diſcloſed. Of this Nature was <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> overture to the <hi>Publick, Who that they might eſcape the Ruine of a raging Peſtilence ſurrounded all the Confines of their Territories, advis'd them timely ſet on Fire the interjacent Foreſts;</hi> whereby the Air being purified, his Country was preſerved from the danger of an encroaching Contagion. In promoting ſuch Advantages to the Publick Benefit, Cuſtom hath ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the uſe of Induſtry, That it will become neceſſary to lend <hi>This</hi> and the ſucceeding Diſtinction, a more material Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31280:60"/> beſides the Grace inherent to a plauſible Reception, then probably may agree with the exact Definition of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our <hi>Subject.</hi> All Arts and Sciences receiving now no other vigour, then what from abject Lucre is inſpir'd.</p>
               <p>4. In perſuit of our Order, enſueth the <hi>Mecanick</hi> Miniſtry to the Advancement or Preſervation of the <hi>Publick</hi> Intereſt; which notwithſtanding <hi>It</hi> may ſeem inferiour to the <hi>Reſt,</hi> as a more proper Subject to leſs elevated Capacities; yet in Reſpect <hi>It</hi> is immediately neceſſary to moſt uſes viſibly inherent to the due ſupport of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. We equally may hereto lend a conſiderable Reflection, not weighing the excellence of <hi>her</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, either in the Curioſity, Rarity, or Delight of <hi>Her</hi> ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but ſoly in the material Conſequence and uſe thereof; eſſentially conducing to the <hi>Civil</hi> Welfare. Of this Quality in the Military practice was <hi>Archimedes</hi> Engines for the Defence of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> againſt the Fury of the <hi>Romans.</hi> Or what other, in <hi>Civil</hi> uſes, may be produced againſt the ſterility of the Soil, Natural, or Adventitious, or what otherwiſe tend to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of a National Commerce. But ſuch hath in our Age, been the unhappy Diſpenſations of Publick Grace, That thoſe Arts have received the moſt eſſential Indulgence and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, That moſt licentiouſly have conduced to Vanity and Lux, contrary to the Reſentment of that generous Prince, <hi>Who prudently weighing tht uſe of every ſingular Faculty, to him, that with infallible Dexterity, could caſt a Grain of Millet through the Eye of a Needle, ordered for Reward a peck of ſeed, he might not want Materials to keep his Skill by frequent Exerciſe.</hi> On this Deſign of Publick Benefit, are grounded the Pretence of moſt <hi>Monopolies;</hi> it ſeeming to a Prince moſt equitable, that every man ſhould ſoly reap the Benefit of his own Induſtry, or Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a time preſcribed, that the Fruition thereof may in future be returned to the publick uſe. But ſuch Motions might poſſibly meet a more plauſible entertainment and a happier Iſſue. If the pretender were enjoyned to attend the Teſt of their own Propoſition, in an approved Conſequence, and totally reſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from all peculiar Benefit therein, depending only on the favour of the Magiſtracy, to make an equal Compenſation, agreeing to the Advantage of the Iſſue.</p>
               <p>Fot cloſure to our Publick Objects of Beneficence, ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Diſtinction of <hi>Munificent;</hi> which in honour to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, we may ſeem in order here to lend but an improper po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, in Reſpect, that all the former Objects may poſſibly be masked with other private or peculiar Intereſts; whereof <hi>This</hi> altogether reſts only unſuſpected, imparting voluntarily of their Own, without a Reference to any Retribution, or peculiar Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit whatever. Yet nevertheleſs, ſince commonly ſuch Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:31280:61"/> proceed rather from the Excreſcence of a private Store, then ſimply the Benignity of a Generous Inclination, wherein is nothing really of our ſelves, or hazzarded, or communicated, and what is ſo diſpenced uſually, but the Fragments of what our Frailty will no longer ſuffer us to enjoy: ſo that the eſſential Circumſtances of the Motive clearly conſidered, we rather, in favour of the publick Intereſt, have lent ſuch a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> here, a more noble Aſſociation, then properly is inherent to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Thereof.</hi> Nor can we thereto yield ſo eminent a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Honor, as might induce Another to an equal Emulation of <hi>Munificence</hi> (where the Donor ſcarce ſurvives the Induction of his Act) more then what the dull Letter of a Monument barely will infer: But to dignifie that Benignity, which ſhall, with a well compoſed Minde, caſt from his Senſe the Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſter to Vanity and Lux; while yet in the Capacity of Fruition, to conſtitute the reviving Affluence thereof upon the languiſhing Miſery of the Indigent, we no way can afford too illuſtrious an Inſcription to <hi>His</hi> Merit.</p>
               <p>2. Before we enter to treat of the <hi>Second</hi> General Object, <hi>A private Beneficence extending beyond the common preſcription of a Civil Devoyr.</hi> Two Arguments, thereon depending, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a more diſtinct ſolution. <hi>Firſt,</hi> whether the <hi>Publick</hi> may immediately be concern'd therein (remotely <hi>It</hi> alwayes of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt.) And whether without ſuch Reference the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> may be concern'd to agitate thereon. The <hi>Firſt</hi> Propoſition may, without Difficulty, admit of an Affirmative. The <hi>Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> not without ſome Intricacy. Inſomuch as private Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence may ſometime be conferred on a private Perſon, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a publick Uſe, <hi>Military,</hi> or <hi>Civil.</hi> And in that ſame Degree oft honoured by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had deſign'd a Crown of Triumph unto him, that had in publick Conflict ſav'd the life but of the meaneſt of their Fellow Citizens; whereby the Band of Unity became amongſt them far more ſtrictly, vigorouſly, and intirely ſecur'd to give a happy repulſe to the fury of their Enemies. But whether the <hi>Publick</hi> be ſo far intereſſed, as to cenſure of the unequal Reſentment of a <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Beneficence</hi> betwixt Party and Party, is a Subject yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined. If example may bear authentick weight to an Aſſertion, we may produce ſufficient evidence from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of many <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdictions, wherein <hi>It</hi> by Preſcription of the Law hath been allowed actionable, as a <hi>Private Plea.</hi> But in more ſevere Governments, proſecuted by the <hi>Publick</hi> as a Capital Delinquence: As may be inſtanced from the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Judicature, <hi>Where</hi> Callias <hi>was publickly arraign'd for his Ingratitude to</hi> Ariſtides, <hi>ſuffering Him and his Children even to periſh through Indigence; by whoſe peculiar favour he had attain'd</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:31280:61"/> 
                  <hi>an eminent Acquiſition.</hi> In Objection to the procedure of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Pattern may juſtly be alledged, that it is againſt the very Nature of a perfect Benefit, ev'n but to expect, much more to exact a Reſtitution. And he that formeth but a Repetition of the Circumſtance of his <hi>Munificence,</hi> blemiſheth the Grace of his Benignity. But he that reduceth <hi>It</hi> to the Reproach of the Receiver, perverteth the Nature of his own Intention. In Reference to the <hi>Latter</hi> Rule, though <hi>This</hi> may be alledg'd no proper Subject for the Inſtitution of the Law: foraſmuch as neither <hi>Publick</hi> nor <hi>Private</hi> prejudice enſueth the Mecogniſance. <hi>This</hi> not endammaged in regard the freeneſs of the Act ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the very ſhadow of a Pretence. <hi>That</hi> not impaired in Reſpect the Conſequence <hi>Thereof</hi> not immediately reacheth the <hi>Publick</hi> Intereſt: collaterally it may, in that the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the vice, not checked, may probably make ſo great a Breach in the moral Conſtitution of our <hi>Civil</hi> Union, as to introduce a common Barbariſme.</p>
               <p>As to the farther Diſcuſſion of our ſuſpended <hi>Subject, A Private Beneficence;</hi> the Nature thereof (under the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Latitude in Devoyr, as formerly expreſt) may ſeem inferior to our former General Object in Excellence conſidered in Groſs; in that, <hi>Bonum quo communius eo melius;</hi> but taken in the mutual Coherency of Parts, of a far greater Efficacy to the Structure of a happy <hi>Union.</hi> To a <hi>Publick</hi> Advantage of <hi>this</hi> Nature rarely is encountered Matter but to work upon, and poſſibly more rarely meeteth a Capacity to entertain <hi>It.</hi> To communicate a <hi>Private Beneficence</hi> every Place, Time, and Perſon affordeth us both Subject and Ability in one kinde or other; ſo that rightly diſtinguiſhed, the moſt adviſed Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors have conſiderately endeavoured on <hi>This</hi> Baiz to erect the Felicity of their <hi>Societies.</hi> But how the <hi>Publick</hi> ſhould diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſuch ſingular Aids totally to be divided from all pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar References, or how cleerly diſcerning their Nature, duly to cheriſh and approve them in an honourable Reception, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence not unworthy the Reflection. For ſolution to the firſt Branch of our Propoſition, we may infer, that he juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to fall unpittied, by a Common Decree, under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of a future Miſery, who ſhall ſo far become reſtrained by the ſhame of his own Indigence or Impotence, as to ſmother in his ſilence either to God or Man, the immediate means to his ſecurity. In Reference to the <hi>Latter</hi> Poſition may be aſſerted, that to ſuch Manifeſtation of the Act, may juſtly follow an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Encouragement from the <hi>Moral Cenſor,</hi> with due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe to dignifie the Action.</p>
               <p>It may here probably be objected, that having propounded our <hi>Subject</hi> in General, we have as yet omitted, clearly to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:31280:62"/> handle all the Dimenſions thereof; inſomuch as we have yet only conſider'd <hi>Vertue</hi> in her Communicative Faculties; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Vertue</hi> frequently wanting ſuch materials, may reſt confin'd, and only but concentrate in It ſelf. In anſwer, Although It may ſeem ev'n againſt the Nature of <hi>Vertue</hi> to be indu'd with an incommunicable Eſſence, ſince both in Example and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, ſhe needeth not to borrow the Endowments of Fortune to illuſtrate her Expanſion: but admit the Influence of her Graces ſo powerful and abſolute from her own proper Nature: Nevertheleſs (to the common reproach of our Age be it atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>Vertue</hi> wants more material Ornaments to plead for her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Who adhereth to the Counſel of the <hi>Wiſeſt,</hi> if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty o're ſhadow the Conſulation, and be his minde never ſo impenetrably compos'd againſt the various and continual Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of an impetuous Adverſity, if obſcured in Indigence, Who regardeth or diſtinguiſheth his <hi>Fortitude.</hi> So both his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> and his <hi>Temperance</hi> ſeem ſmothered in his Impotence. But happier Ages lend us more exemplary Preſidents from their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, where we may obſerve, that in the moſt flouriſhing <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, Vertue</hi> ſo humbly ſeated, did never want her Dignity, as appeareth in the Antick Grecian Glory, extracted from the Juſtice of <hi>Ariſtides.</hi> The Prudence and Moderation of <hi>Phocion.</hi> The Fortitude and Magnanimity of <hi>Epimenondes.</hi> Nor ſhall we need here farther to trace a Preſcription to qualifie ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence with Honour, ſince we already have in the Inception of our Treatiſe thereon rais'd the true Capacity to our <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Under the Intimation of <hi>Divine,</hi> we chiefly may compriſe Enormities are perpetrated againſt God, or his Sacred Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which being the Supream Authority, from whence all humane power pretends to be deriv'd, ſhould more ſeverely be preſerv'd from violation, ev'n to the due Conformity of the ſubordinate <hi>Miniſtry.</hi> And although we may in this Inſertion, ſeem to digreſs from the Intention of our preſent <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> as an improper Object to our <hi>Civil Miniſter,</hi> extending far beyond the Latitude of his Faculty: yet, inſomuch as the Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Menaces, or Exhortations of the Divine Miniſter, are unto Carnal and to ſenſual Spirits but an ineffectual Procedure to the due Reſtraint of our common Corruption, where the <hi>Civil Miniſter</hi> becomes not coadjutant to rectifie the Diſorder, we may conclude the inconſiderate Neglect Hereof muſt inevitably form the <hi>Civil Power</hi> leſs ſucceſsful in her <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> declining totally to agitate on the Infringement of Superior Orders. The Fundamental Eſtabliſhment of their own. The firſt and higheſt Degree in ſuch Delinquence, is <hi>the denying of his Eſſence,</hi> who of free Grace and Goodneſs imparted to us ours, which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimour moſt juſtly may deſerve the Forfeiture of his Tenor.</p>
               <p>Subordinate to <hi>This,</hi> is <hi>the Derogating from his Sacred Attributes,</hi> which being properly and immediately inherent to his Holy Eſſence, more opprobiouſly and maliciouſly endeavoureth in Contempt to deny that ſupream Power, he is enforced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge: Nor can ſuch a preſumptuous Repugnance againſt the inward Light be reputed in humane ſenſe leſs hainous <hi>then</hi> the former.</p>
               <p>Contingent to <hi>Theſe</hi> is <hi>the Prophanation of his Name and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance,</hi> either in Licentious Diſcourſes or Actions, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irreverently to the Miſpriſion of his adorable Eſſence, or his Holy Rites: which extravagant inſolence may juſtly merit to be ſuſpended from the Priviledge of a <hi>Common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Collateral <hi>hereto</hi> is <hi>the ſolemn Invocation of his Sacred Name to the Atteſtation of a matter falſe, or falſified;</hi> which without
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31280:63"/> Reference to anothers Intereſt, as the Signet only of our own ſerious Reſolutions, is a Crime of a moſt reproachful Levity, which requireth before God and Man, a penitent and high ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

               <p>Farthermore we may yet hereto not improperly inſert the <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>too frequent uſage of His Name in vain;</hi> which heedleſs Cuſtom forming into Habit, inſenſibly detracteth from that awful Reverence, ſhould be revived in us on every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Intimation of <hi>his</hi> glorious Diſtinction. Nor can a more effectual Reſtraint be formed to ſuppreſs ſuch unadviſed Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, then a private Reproof or a publick Reproach from <hi>His</hi> peculiar Miniſter.</p>
               <p>2. What may enſue from the Licentiouſneſs of <hi>Vice</hi> to the Infringement of the <hi>Civil</hi> Order, we here may properly omit to treat upon: inſomuch, as the general Inference <hi>Thereof</hi> hath herein only Reference to the Impeachment of anothers Intereſt directly and immediately. A common Principle to the Deciſion of right, which may more clearly be enlightned in the peculiar Order, we deſign to the Diſcuſſion of each Branch thereof, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may here generaly Note, that ev'n therein moſt Laws too ſtrictly oft adhere more to the litteral formalities of a Plea, then the eſſential Reſult of a Proof.</p>

               <p>Unity and Concord being the chief Objects ſhould guide us to the laſting Eſtabliſhment of a happy <hi>Society,</hi> it will be mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially pertinent in the ſearch thereof, to viſit the primitive and ſecret underminings of a mutual Agreement, which may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be diſcovered in the firſt ſubtle Practice of Mans common Adverſary, under the Figure of a concealed <hi>Malice;</hi> whence <hi>This</hi> privy Ranchor ſhould take Original, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be judged from a repining Envy, contracted by the ſenſe of a Diſparity in their preſent Conditions. <hi>This</hi> ſeed of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sedition from thence ſcattered into the Heart of man, to finiſh in our overthrow, what This Impoſture had ſo effectually commenced, by a perpetual commotion in our <hi>Civil</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, hath enforced the exacteſt Conſtitutors of a <hi>Civil Society</hi> (not being able to extirpate the Roots <hi>hereof)</hi> utterly to remove

               <p>At firſt Inſpection it may appear an Impropriety in our order, here to inſert the Treatiſe of a <hi>Slaunder,</hi> being a <hi>Subject</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Law within the Limits of a <hi>Civil</hi> Penalty, but with ſo ſtrict a Reference to the <hi>Letter,</hi> that few Degrees of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy will, under the common Rules thereof, fall within the exact Diſtinction of a Scandal: as if the nice Formalities of the Law intended but to ſport with private and refined Infamy. To ſupply this Default in a <hi>Civil</hi> Preſcription, we will endeavour yet more amply to define the Nature of <hi>Slaunders, Calumnies,</hi> and <hi>Detractions,</hi> with their enſuing Damages to a <hi>Civil</hi> Union, leſt that their proper and implicit Sences ſhould become con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded under the Notion of one common Diſtinction.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. How material Breaches in a <hi>Civil Union,</hi> may enſue the ſufferance or the ſlight Reſtraint of <hi>Slaunder</hi> (though taken in the obſcureſt and remoteſt Latitude of Sence) may evidently be conceived, when we ſhall ſeriouſly reflect on the inefficeable Impreſſions are ſecretly left behinde the Publick Diſcuſſion <hi>Thereof,</hi> in the unreſolv'd Conjecture of the Auditors: So that though the miſchief of the ſuggeſtor be clearly convicted, the innocence of the Plantiffe remains not fully vindicated, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:31280:64"/> unequal Reſentments become fomented, to proſecute ſuch illegal Reparations, as probably may extend to the extinction of many <hi>Families,</hi> if not unto a general Commotion in the <hi>Civil Frame.</hi> Nor can the extent of a Legal Verdict, directed only to a pecuniary Amercement, become an equal compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Injury. Where the malicious Impeacher of anothers Fame remains unbranded with ſuch Publick Infamy, may render him more obvious to a <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Calumny,</hi> though formed from the ſame Original, makes ſlighter Incurſions on our <hi>Civil</hi> Fame; yet may the leaſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <hi>Thereof</hi> not paſs the Burden of a <hi>Civil</hi> Cenſure, ſince our common Reputation is the viſible Foundation to our Livlihood, or <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty: So that the ſecret and frequent Expanſion <hi>thereof</hi> meeting with the Corruption of our humane Nature (prone to exagerate the very ſhadow of anothers Infirmity) may poſſibly reach the extinction of the Natural Exiſtence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Detraction</hi> takes a lower flight, by remote Tracts to winde the Matter to as high a pitch, leſſening <hi>It</hi> ſelf till <hi>It</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come not obvious to the ſence; which with more Art diſguis'd, requires more Art in the Diſcovery. <hi>Her</hi> Traces hold no uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, but often ſhift the ſhadows of the Scene to trouble or confound the Appearance of the Matter, with an Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or opponant Light. So that the Intereſſed not only hereby hazzardeth his preſent Advantages, but becomes unequally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacht of Evils not in queſtion. While the envious Impoſture caſts the Contagion of his Venome, without the Danger of Contraction. From hence (though more remote in Nature, more ſudden in the Operation; and conſequently more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the Circumſpection) proceed Acts of <hi>Incivility,</hi> as <hi>Affronts,</hi> or <hi>Diſgraces</hi> in general, <hi>Scoffings,</hi> and <hi>Deridings.</hi> The malignities of the <hi>Former</hi> moving more ſlowly, afford a time to lend the <hi>Civil Miniſter</hi> a Capacity to allay or ſtop the vigour of the Infirmity e're it attain the height. <hi>Theſe,</hi> like Tinder, catching fire at the firſt Eruption, ſeldome become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſht, but with untimely Slaughter. In which Regard, It may become a wonder to a digeſted ſence, to finde moſt Laws ſo unprovided or ſo ſlack in the Reſtraint <hi>hereof,</hi> as not, in the leaſt manner, to reflect on their Nature, or their Conſequence, ſince both directly tend to the Infringement of the <hi>Publick</hi> Peace. By which Neglect the injured is prompted to purſue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Reparation to his wrongs. <hi>Affronts</hi> more inſolently and deliberately determine a Diviſion in the <hi>Civil Frame. Scoffing</hi> more ſlily and obliquely. The Arrogance of <hi>That</hi> ſeems to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a priviledge to impoſe a Rule. The ſubtlety of <hi>This,</hi> but to inſinuate a form in common uſage.</p>
               <p>Not inferiour to <hi>theſe</hi> are Acts of <hi>Inhumanity,</hi> whether in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:31280:64"/> the omiſſion, or in the rigorous and untimely execution of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Rights; which moſt men (judging ſoly confined to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or permiſſion of the Law) make thoſe the Stations of their <hi>Civil</hi> Duty, which are but fixed Lights, erected only on the extreams to avoid thoſe ſhelves procure a common ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. To the <hi>firſt</hi> Point we muſt come, to the <hi>Latter</hi> we may come, under this Caution, <hi>Summum Jus, ſumma injuria. Extream Right, is extream Wrong.</hi> Betwixt <hi>theſe,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Continent of a <hi>Civil</hi> Devoyr, there are many Degrees of Latitude, not ſpecified in the Letter, to leave the will more Freedom in the Election of the Good or Evil, which thereby only are intitled ours. Nor can he juſtly be admitted as a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to the <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, whoſe Actions do endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face the very Nature of that Being doth qualifie him with his Diſtinction. How far <hi>This</hi> Savage Attribute may be repugnant to our <hi>Civil</hi> Order, explicitly is implyed in Intimation of the ſence <hi>Thereof,</hi> expreſſed in the Letter, inferring a ſatisfactory and inflexible perſiſting to the Deſtruction of our kinde. To what extent might be reduc'd the Nature of our <hi>Subject,</hi> not eaſily is diſtinguiſht; ſince each remorſleſs ſence of others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering tending to Ruine, we impoſe or farther, may form thereto a perfect Definition. A proof whereof adjudg'd, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from * that <hi>Roman's</hi> entertainment, <hi>Who, on Reception of his Page, that much perplext his Sickneſs had detain'd him till the Period of the War, in that he ne're had ſeen the Slaughter of a Man. To ſatisfie his Reproachful Curioſity, commanded ſtraight a Criminel to the Block:</hi> for which he by the <hi>Cenſor</hi> was expell'd the Senate.</p>
               <p>As Twins, falling under one Similitude in Nature, may here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to be annexed Acts <hi>unnatural,</hi> as the Inemnity and Neglect between Parents and their Children; Brother and Brother, and other nigh Relations in Affinity; where both Divine and <hi>Civil</hi> Inſtitutions joyn to engraft the ſtricteſt Band of Unity, to lay a firmer Baiz unto the laſting Structure of a <hi>Civil</hi> Government, as may be inſtanc't in Conjunction of old <hi>Iſraels</hi> Tribes, who farther were by ſevere Laws enjoyn'd to ſupport and ſupply the Members of their Families, even to the nigheſt union. Nor can in Reaſon it be figured, that any perſon Cordially ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto the <hi>Publick</hi> Intereſts in remote Agitations, who ſo reproachfully deſerteth the Contingence of his own in a nigher Intercourſe.</p>
               <p>Not far remov'd from <hi>This</hi> in Conſequence are Actions of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> when as the due Reſentment of a free and timely Comfort to an afflicted Condition utterly is extinguiſhed, an Impropriety ſo incongruous to a <hi>Civil</hi> Community, That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe in every Beaſt may lend <hi>It</hi> infamy. The Oxe and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31280:65"/> the Aſs know and acknowledge the hand to them adminiſters. And the moſt Savage will become reclaim'd, where they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to Nature a Refection; whence man, of all diſtinguiſhing Creatures, ſhould receive ſo unequal an Impreſſion, muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be the Arrogance of his haughty Spirit, deteſting to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear inferiour by a <hi>Civil</hi> Fealty: or elſe the Avarice of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Nature, retracting the Acknowledgement, leſt It in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules might challenge a due Compenſation: Both which Sour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to a <hi>Civil</hi> Union equally incommunicable. How far the Iſſue yet may probably obſtruct the Circular Motion of our <hi>Civil</hi> Body, in a reproachful <hi>Mecogniſance,</hi> may, to the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſence be clearly evident; conſidering no Conſequence can ſooner form Reluctance in the will, to do another good, then where our full Endeavours meet ſo bruitiſh a Reception.</p>
               <p>Having thus traced out ſome irregular Motions in our <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, under a more Eſpecial Reference unto <hi>others;</hi> we will endeavour now to treat of ſome Diſorders, under a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Reference to our <hi>Selves,</hi> not pretending to attain the full extent of either. But to caſt ſuch a ſhadow thereof on our preſent <hi>Work,</hi> as may comparatively form the unexpreſſed more diſtinguiſhable, and hold a fairer <hi>Simitry</hi> with the Capacity of our <hi>Treatiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Subjects</hi> we would hereupon infer, are Actions of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs,</hi> as <hi>Drunkenneſs, Luxury, Gaming, Riot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> may poſſibly appear a <hi>Subject</hi> here improperly inſerted in our Order; in that moſt Laws may ſeem to form thereto a due Punition. Yet in Reference to the Nature of the Crime, not totally equivolent, weighing judiciouſly the common Damage thereon may enſue unto the <hi>Civil</hi> Texture, in regard it is a reproachful exhauſter of the Publick Store. A certain Ruine to a private Family. An apparent Introduction to every Miſchief. A temporary Diſſection of a Member from the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. Under what Degree of Diſorder this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per truly may be diſtinguiſhed, is not altogether unworthy a due Perpenſation, ſince the vulgar, in favour of their ſenſuality, have lent <hi>It</hi> ſo groſs and ridiculous a Character, as is not to be encountered but in the higheſt extremity. But far more ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally may be affirmed, That every extravagant Emotion of the Spirit, and every impotent and irregular Motion of the Body, by drink procur'd, may figure the Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Under the Intimation of <hi>Luxury</hi> may be imply'd all ſenſual Exceſſes whatſoever, more eſpecially the inordinate Indulgence to the inticing Reliſhes of the Pallate, and the laſcivious and unlawful Proſecution of a Bruitiſh Luſt, How far the common Conſequences <hi>Hereof</hi> may reach the Detriment of the <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, we will endeavour clearly to enlighten. Our <hi>Subject</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:31280:65"/> taken in the <hi>former</hi> Sence, is not only a ſuperfluous Conſumer of the Publick Affluence to the enhancing of Proviſions, moſt uſeful to a common Exiſtence; but, with the inevitable Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to our own private Fortunes, alſo a viſible extinguiſher of That, which <hi>It</hi> pretendeth but to cheriſh, ſmothering or enfeebling the innate Heat, the immediate Inſtrument to every Faculty of Nature. So that not only the Body, but the minde becomes hereby obſcur'd, effeminate and ſlothful, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unuſeful to every <hi>Civil</hi> Practice. Farthermore, the Charms of this Indulgence to our proper <hi>Genius,</hi> ſo endeareth the Affections to a bruitiſh Senſuality, that it totally alienates the Thought from any ſenſe of others ſuffering, ſo far, that <hi>It</hi> becomes unto the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame a Burden incommunicable. <hi>This</hi> Subject taken in the <hi>Latter Sence,</hi> though from the other ſeldom found divided, the <hi>Latter</hi> being uſually joynt Iſſue to the <hi>former,</hi> meeting a Celibate Condition, begetteth either a Protraction, or a perpetual Renunciation of an <hi>Hymeneal</hi> Union, both puniſhable by the Law in <hi>Civil</hi> Communities of ſeverer Diſcipline, encountring a Conjugal Eſtate, <hi>It</hi> breaks that Band of Amity, which is the firſt ſtricteſt and moſt natural Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a <hi>Civil</hi> Union, in either (if any) <hi>It</hi> produceth but a ſpurious and degenerate Iſſue.</p>
               <p>That ſence which the <hi>Former Attribute</hi> could not reach to in the common uſage of our <hi>Tongue,</hi> more properly may under the notion of <hi>Riot</hi> be expreſt, having for Object a ſervile Aſſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Adulation of the ſenſes (not formerly thereby inferr'd) at how profuſe a rate ſoever: ſo that, in Reſpect of the vanity, This Piece of <hi>Liceatiouſneſs</hi> hath a Latitude beyond the Capacity of a Preſcription; whether in the Curious, Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or Superfluous Ornaments inherent to a Perſon, Place, or Equipage; or in the alluring Rarities or Exceſſes of an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, tending rather to exhauſt the Affluence of Nature, then ſatisfie with her Plenty. Where Noiſe and Vapour to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the aiery ſenſes more, o're ballance in expence the Reſt. Or what other fantaſtick Miniſtry to a diſtemper'd Fancy, tends but to form prodigious vanity, or a ridiculous ſingularity, which ſometime meets ſo high extravagance, that ſundry Figures, Drawn, Cut, or Grav'd in the Mettal, Earth, or Stone, (under the Honour only of Antiquity) become the price of a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Revenue. What meaſure of Diſorder may hereby be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, will clearly be diſtinguiſht in thoſe Breaches, which the moſt flouriſhing <hi>Societies</hi> have ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo impetuous a diſtemper, which like a raging Fire conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth All to ſatisfie <hi>It</hi> ſelf, leaving no Rights unviolated. No Miſchief unpractiſed, to yield new Fuel to the corrupted ſenſe, when the Materials fail to ſatiate the unbridled will. <hi>This</hi> Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:31280:66"/> of the Wanton Blood moſt uſually is engendred in the Greater Veſſels of the <hi>Civil</hi> Body, from whence <hi>It</hi> by the leſſer is attracted, by affected Emulation, till <hi>It</hi> become a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Infirmity, whereby the whole Frame, voluptuouſly effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, becomes incapable of any generous Action, ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a prey to the ſlighteſt Incurſions of an Enemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaming,</hi> not taken in the ſence of a Divertiſement, but in the Nature of an ardent Perſuit to a diſhonourable Acquiſition, where the Adventurer, to improve the Advantage of his Stock, puts it to the Queſtion, whether his juſt Poſſeſſions be his own. A ridiculous and bewitching Itch of Avarice, where each one, in ſport, perſues Anothers Ruine in earneſt. In the Victor the Facility of the Acquiſition begets a Profuſeneſs in expence. In the vanquiſht a ſelf-conſuming Ranck our to repair the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: ſo that neither attain the end of the undertaking, ſince both become fruſtrate in the Improvement of their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>former</hi> ſwelleth with vanity of ſucceſs, although not raiſed on his own ſufficiency. The latter ſhrinks away de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as guilty of his Folly, more than aſhamed of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Nor yet alwayes ſo ſilently paſſeth the Debate, Execrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Imprecations uſually fill up the Scenes, which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are cloſed in a Tragick Iſſue, the interlude too probably the Prelude to a Quarrel.</p>
               <p>How materially the unreſtrained Liberty hereof may conduce to the Dammage of a <hi>Civil</hi> Society, we need not to infer, when we ſhall reflect upon the Conſequence of the Practice, tending to a certain and ſudden extirpation of a Family, where the falling Pillar not only ſhattereth his own Branches, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becomes an uſeleſs Burden to the whole <hi>Frame</hi> in a paſſive Indigence, or a common Incendiary in ſiniſter Practiſes, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Recruit by deſperate Attempts. We have omitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to every exorbitance an equal Penalty, according to our former Order. In Reſpect that divers Circumſtances, both in Action, Place, Perſon, Age, Sex, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may not only vary the Meaſure of the Error, but the Nature alſo of the Penalty, which can only meet a plauſible Infliction in the Judicious Impoſition of the Moral <hi>Cenſor.</hi>

               <p>Though the explicit ſence of <hi>Acquiſition</hi> may ſeem impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applyed to ſo ſolemn an Inſtitution, as a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that the ſympathetick Influence of Nature often Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly determines the Contract, before the Overture is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, conſtituting the ſubſequent Agreement rather a <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> then a ſollicitous Capitulation: nevertheleſs in Reſpect, the implicit Inference <hi>thereof</hi> may reach beyond the vulgar uſage of our <hi>Tongue,</hi> we will apply <hi>It</hi> to the vulgar uſage of the Ceremony, being in their Practiſe frequently, but a Mercinary Compact: under which Latitude of Sence, may be compriſed divers ſpecies of <hi>Conjugal Acquiſition;</hi> as that of <hi>Violence,</hi> which probably may be judged the moſt improper and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful kinde imaginable.

The Supream, Sacred, moſt General, and Authentick Rules to illuminate our wayes in the intercourſe of humane Society afford us no appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Proof of <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union, but what hath been derived from the Agreement of the natural Parent, whoſe Reception of the Addreſſes properly did form the Introduction to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: inſomuch, as the firſt moſt viſible and legitimate Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Right, is that which is extracted from the courſe of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31280:67"/> Nature. <hi>This</hi> Procedure ſeems alſo moſt authentickly confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd in the Formality of the Ceremony, where the Tranſaction paſſeth from the Parents hand, or one that Perſonates his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. In competition to the Filial Liberty herein (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably might leſſen the Nature of the Treſpaſs) may be alledg'd the Irreſiſtable Influence of the Celeſtial Orbes ordain'd to ſuch Impreſſions on Inferior Bodies, as may impulſively attract them to an Union, without the Conſultation of the will, which not ſubmitting to the exacteſt Reſult of the Interior Light, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their Motion, may equitably be diſpenc't from the ſubordinance to anothers will, when as not under the ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own. Nor can the Advantages of Fortune, which uſually herein o're-ſway the Parents Inclination, be a plauſible Inducement to ſo material a Conſequence, where the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Inſtitution dependeth immediately on the mutual Agreement of the Interior Faculties; which in their Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can produce but a degenerate Compoſure in Another, when formed from ſo Groſs and Corrupt an Object. In favour of the <hi>Treſpaſſor,</hi> where her <hi>Civil</hi> endowments are but volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or caſual, may be alledged the Sincerity of the Motive to an honourable Perſuit, limiting his Pretences in the Fruition only of her Perſon, without the Inherences to her Fortune, having in the Diſorder of his Proceeding fruſtrated his Capacity to acquite it. From the Reſult of our Diſcuſſion, may poſſibly be formed a Concluſion ſufficient to ſuſpend the Impeached from a Capital Offence: but nothing yet from thence inferr'd, might counterpoiſe the Parents Injury in the Miſcarriage of a Childe, did the Loſs extend no farther then the Raviſhing of his Comfort might have redounded from the endearments of an agreeable Community, if but eſtabliſht by his Counſel or Election. In Reference therefore to the <hi>Treſpaſſors</hi> may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that to the Diſobedience of the <hi>Childe</hi> is juſtly bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced the forfeiture of her Patrimonial Inherency. To the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence of the <hi>Violator,</hi> ſuch Reparation in Honour, as the Dignity of the Family may require. In the ſequel of our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe remaineth yet a Difficulty not enlightned, whether <hi>It</hi> reſt in the <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity of the <hi>Parent</hi> to diſanul the Contract paſt by Nuptial Ceremony? For ſolution to the Queſtion, may be reply'd, Few Laws herein diſſent from the Affirmative. But how ſuch Procedure may be conſiſtent with the Honour or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Childe, or yet the <hi>Parents</hi> future Satisfaction (All conjugal Rights tranſacted) is indiſtinguiſhable.</p>
               <p>Another kinde of Conjugal <hi>Acquiſition,</hi> more properly ſo tearmed, is the <hi>Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>al Acquiſitions</hi> where the <hi>Acquiſitor</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſeth his Pretences from the <hi>Parent,</hi> for a certain ſumme of Mony, or other Conſideration, which paſſeth ſometime under
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31280:68"/> the formality of a Preſent. A Method of <hi>Acquiſition</hi> very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and unſuitable to the Practice of our Age, where the higheſt perfection of perſonal Endowments, cannot win ſo much as the ſhadow of Attraction on our ſordid Inclinations: yet wants it not the Authority of the exacteſt Models of a <hi>Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> to form the Inſtitution Regular. Probably in Reſpect, that ſuch Proceeding is the higheſt Pledge to an inviolable Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſureſt and moſt plauſible Foundation to the happy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and end of ſo neceſſary an Inſtitution. But whether ſuch Forms of Contract may meet no Inconvenient in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, is not ſo clearly obvious: Inſomuch as the Nature of the Introduction may poſſibly figure a more high and unequal Inherence to the <hi>Property,</hi> then probably may be conſiſtant with ſo perfect an Amity; ſeeming in the intention, rather to imply a Diſtance of Servilty, then a Coadjutance in the Miniſtry: We may therefore herein conclude, that a mutual Retribution of the <hi>Civil</hi> Faculties is as proper an Order to a happy Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this <hi>Civil <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> as the reciprocal communication of the <hi>Natural</hi> Faculties is to the ſucceſsful Conſtitution of the <hi>Natural</hi> Union: yet in either Tranſaction will ſuch a method be prepoſterous, if the Motive thereto do proceed rather from the means, then from the end or Object of the Inſtitution: to the perfect forming whereof, the <hi>former</hi> ſhould be but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed ſubſequent to the <hi>latter,</hi> not a primary and viſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement. Such Procedure, among the <hi>Spartans,</hi> adjudged ſo irregular to a happy <hi>Union,</hi> that <hi>It</hi> fell, by publick Ordinance, under the Cenſure of a <hi>Civil</hi> Penalty.</p>
               <p>The ſucceeding <hi>Title</hi> to a Conjugal Adherence is that of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> the moſt uſual, proper, and legitimate Method in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting ſo material an <hi>Union,</hi> where the uncorrupted will moves freely to a deliberate Reſult in the Election, that a happy and agreeable Community may thence iſſue to every Branch inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Alliance. To what Latitude the Agreement of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may juſtly be extended, is a Subject not altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. The <hi>Parent</hi> and the <hi>Eſpous'd</hi> may probably here li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Propoſition, though Cuſtom, in <hi>Civil</hi> uſage, requires it ev'n from the Remoteſt of the Family, yet rather under a Form of Ceremony, then a Pretence of Right. But why the Maternal Aſſent (ſhe being the ſole Regent to her Family) ſhould here not be admitted to an equal Priviledge, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Authority to her deceaſed Husband, as to appear a Principle in the Ceremony, is a <hi>Civil</hi> Impropriety, ſcarce ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a Rational Pretence, unleſs the practice be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily waved, in favour to the decent Reſtraint of a womanly Paſſion, which might poſſibly extend to a diſorderly Erruption, perſonally to ſeparate from her ſelf by her own publick Act,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31280:68"/> Whom tender Nature had ſo nighly united.</p>
               <p>From the example of that exact Pattern of Morality, <hi>Cato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis</hi> may here be poſſibly inferr'd a Propoſition, which ſeldom could elſewhere finde out a Preſident, but in licentious Practiſes, whether <hi>this Conjugal</hi> inherence may be (with due conformity to <hi>Civil</hi> Rules) tranſacted by the Principle to anothers Poſſeſſion, as a Common <hi>Property.</hi> The ſolution may properly without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, paſs in the Negative. Inſomuch as there was a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Reception in the Contract, and the Husband not in right impowr'd to alienate himſelf from her Poſſeſſion; to whom he was conferr'd by his own proper Act, Nor can a joynt Conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from both Principles from equitably a Retraction of ſo ſtrict a vow in ſo ſolemn an Inſtitution. In Reference to <hi>Cato</hi>'s procedure herein may be alledg'd, that ſuch elevated and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Spirits, have in the ſource and courſe of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties more noble Objects, then the vulgar can reflect upon, as the plauſible Reception of his Wife again on her firſt Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood may expreſs. Such Traces therefore can viſibly form no proper Rules to common Actions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>latter</hi> Method of a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Inveſture is that of a <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion,</hi> an Order not any where found in uſe, but in the <hi>Judaick</hi> Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there alſo under a Conditional Poſition, <hi>If the Brother dyed without iſſue.</hi> The intention of the Preſcription had poſſibly both explicitly and implicitly a plauſible Perſuit. Explicitly, the ſupport of the Brothers Name and Family. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, that ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ighneſs of Relation might more peculiarly in them engraft a ſtricter <hi>Union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the Right of <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> muſt neceſſarily proceed the Right of Inſtitution, either <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> as the Legiſlative Power ſhall adjudge moſt proper to the Nature of the Tranſaction; which concluding in the <hi>latter,</hi> may poſſibly lend more weight unto the Ordinance: But both tending to a due and orderly eſtabliſhment, require authentick Publication, to avoid promiſcuous, ſcandalous, and litigious mixtures. Whence conſequently enſues this Propoſition, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private and concealed Contracts, under what form ſoever paſſed, tending to a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union, may be admitted to the full Capacity of a legal Inſtitution. For ſolution, may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that ſuch Agreement equally and effectually may engage the Tranſactors to a mutual Coherence. But not oblige the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society</hi> to an equal Reception of their Tranſactions under ſuch Diſtinction, until by perfect and authentick Publication ſpecified.</p>
               <p>One Ambignity inherent to our <hi>Subject,</hi> may probably here require a due Diſcuſſion, whether the Allowance of <hi>Poligamy</hi> might prove conſonant or uſeful to our <hi>Civil</hi> Order. If the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity or ſecurity of a <hi>Civil</hi> Society conſiſted in a numerous
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31280:69"/> multitude; the certain'ſt means to attain it in a lawful Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be allowed warrantable. But queſtionleſs, a due Proportion of the parts thereof is requiſite to form a perfect Harmony in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. A noxious Repletion may as well happen to the Body <hi>Politick</hi> as <hi>Natural;</hi> both <hi>Quoad Vires.</hi> Inreſpect of becoming a burden to the whole Frame, or <hi>Quoad Vaſſa.</hi> In regard of the exceſſive Extent of each peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent beyond a due Capacity of Reception. Furthermore, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> being the ſole Object of a <hi>Civil</hi> Felicity, can no way ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be attained in ſo unequal a Diverſity.</p>
               <p>Having thus lent a legitimate Preſcription to the <hi>Conjugal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> e're we proceed to treat upon the ſubſequent Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, it will be yet material here to trace a Rule to their legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Separation,</hi> in Reſpect, it poſſibly may extend to ſo valid a Retraction, that each ſurviving party may legally be endowed with Capacity to tranſact their Perſons, on another in a new Election.</p>
               <p>To what Latitude of ſence a legal <hi>Separation</hi> here may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is not yet clearly obvious, ſince vulgar uſage thereby only would imply a temporary Diviſion, either voluntary or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive. The <hi>Total</hi> only falling under notion of Divorce.</p>
               <p>In Reference therefore to ſuch Diſtinction, we will proceed to agitate on their Nature. <hi>A Conjugal Separation</hi> is either <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralegal,</hi> or <hi>Voluntary,</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Impulſive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Extralegal</hi> or <hi>Voluntary Separation</hi> is ſuch a Diviſion in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Union, as may be conſtituted by mutual Aſſent or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parties, which may either be repealed or continued, without any Procedure or Formality of the Law.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Legal Separation</hi> is ſuch, as by due courſe of Law becomes impoſed on complaint. and by due courſe of Law, may with conſent of Parties be repealable; if irrepealable, the true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction <hi>Thereof</hi> more properly falls under Nature of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Extralegal</hi> or <hi>Voluntary Separation</hi> form'd from Divine or Moral Preſcription, not reaching any <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance, we will omit here farther to diſcuſs upon, as altogether improper to our <hi>Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Legal</hi> or <hi>Impulſive Separation</hi> preſents unto us a double Ambiguity, whether, and on what Ground, ſuch <hi>Separation,</hi> may plauſibly be conſtituted by a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Act under ſuch <hi>Separation</hi> paſſed joyntly or ſeverally, wherein both Parties are concerned, may be accounted valid.</p>
               <p>For ſolution, we may conclude, that ſuch a Procedure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may juſtly fall under the Conceſſion of a <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature. But with this ſtrict Limitation only, where a viſible Attempt hath been practiſed againſt the Life of either party by the joynt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31280:69"/> Aſſociate, in regard our common ſafety is the immediate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>Civil</hi> praeſcription. And although it here may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the <hi>Civil</hi> Texture hath more forceable and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rules form'd in it ſelf to the due reſtraint of ſuch Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Yet where the Fewel to the Action ſo nighly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually is fomented, the <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature might juſtly be held guilty of the barbarous Iſſue, ſhould <hi>It</hi> decline from the removal of ſuch opportunity, might miniſter to the Miſchief.</p>
               <p>As to the Tranſactions joyntly may concern the <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union under a <hi>legal Separation,</hi> we either may reduce them to a <hi>Civil</hi> or a <hi>Natural</hi> Reference. The <hi>Civil</hi> have their Limits under private Contract or under publique Ordinance.</p>
               <p>The Natural ſuſpended by Decree, cannot without a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Repeal, either ſeveraly or joyntly tranſacted, attain a true Legitimacy.</p>
               <p>The nature of a <hi>Divorce,</hi> extendeth to a vaſter Latitude, having for Object a total or perpetual <hi>Separation</hi> from a <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Society,</hi> impulſively conſtituted by a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance,</p>
               <p>But under what Remonſtrance ſuch a cenſure may juſtly paſs the <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature, is not ſo fully ſpecified. Acts of Adultery are only explicit'ly expreſſed in the ſacred Letter, and ſo far pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by the Inſtitution of the Civil Law, but under ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity and Difficulty in the diſtinction, that the intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of totally thereby becomes fruſtrate. In Reference to the <hi>Firſt</hi> obſtacle, where the ground of the Procedure falls under a criminel Treſpaſs. The Praeſcription vainly tendeth to a <hi>Civil</hi> Diviſion, in Relation to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> where the Charge requireth an occular Teſtimony to forme the Impeachment regular; the proof reſts totally o're-ſhadowed with a humane impoſſibility.</p>
               <p>We may yet more properly hereto annex ſuch incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities as may fruſtrate the intention of the <hi>Conjugal</hi> Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whether <hi>Civil, Natural,</hi> or <hi>Accidental.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Under the Notion of a <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity, may paſs not only ſuch, as are excluded by a common Praeſcription in the <hi>Civil</hi> Order, as <hi>Ideots, Lunaticks. &amp;c.</hi> But ſuch Relations alſo of a Blood, as in regard of their Proximity may decently fall under Legal Interdiction, <hi>Qui loco Parentum inter ſe habent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Under the diſtinction of a <hi>Natural</hi> Incapacity, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch incorrigeable Imperfections, as by nature happen through the error of her work.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Accidental</hi> Incapacity may be extended to Praeternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or Artificial Affections.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Praeternatural,</hi> where either Naturally or Adventiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, <hi>ex morboſa aliqua conſtitutione partis aliquid deeſt, vel ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereſt; by imperfect conſtitution of Parts, ſome thing is either wanting or ſuperfluous.</hi> The <hi>Latter</hi> Imperfection may fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>Under an <hi>Artificial</hi> Incapacity may be inſerted ſuch an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, as is contracted by inward Aſſumption or outward Application, or by Enchantment, as <hi>Ligati.</hi> But in reſpect ſuch diſabilities ſeldom are incorrigeable, we cannot juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from capacity of <hi>Conjugal</hi> union.</p>
               <p>Some difficulties inherent to our <hi>Subject</hi> may pertinently be here enlightned, as whether ſuch a legal Incapacity ought to be ſubſequent or preceding the <hi>Conjugal</hi> Aſſociation? And whither ſuch an Incapacity prediſtinguiſhable may juſtly, in concealment, fall under cenſure of a <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Poſition ſeems a ſcruple ſcarce worth an Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Since every juſt pretence of a Retraction in agreement (of this kind) is grounded on Deffaut preceeding contract. The <hi>Latter</hi> being a Subject more proper to another <hi>Principle</hi> we will remit to their peculiar Order.</p>
               <p>2. From the perfect fruition of the <hi>Firſt Property</hi> uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the juſteſt <hi>Acquiſition</hi> of the <hi>Second. Children,</hi> which nevertheleſs, without ſo ſtrict a Reference, materially may be conſidered under the Diſtinction of the <hi>Natural</hi> and the <hi>Civil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Natural Acquiſition</hi> is either <hi>Ligitimate</hi> or <hi>Illegitimate.</hi> The <hi>Civil</hi> only is <hi>Adoptive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The moſt proper and agreeable coherence is without doubt the <hi>Natural,</hi> in which our very Eſſence ſeems in the Currant of ſucceſſion transferred to Eternity, without which, Mans ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful endeavors (though Crown'd with opulence and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,) yield in their fulleſt Affluence but an imperfect ſatisfaction, their charming Harmony ſtill grating the affected Heart, with the good Patriarchs interjected Diſcord. <hi>Quid mihi.</hi> That the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legitimate Dependence, though naturally conſtituted, ſhould reach ſo high a conſequence, can ſcarcely be affirmed. Since Infamy and Infidelity aſſociate the Production.</p>
               <p>It will therefore be materially pertinent to our Order fully to appropriate unto either their Diſtinctions. <hi>Children</hi> intitled with Adherence of <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> may ſuch be figured either <hi>properly</hi> or <hi>improperly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Properly,</hi> ſuch, as after due ſolemnity of their Nuptial Rites, are in due ſeaſon and maturety of time produc't.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Improperly,</hi> ſuch as before Terme, under Terme, or after Terme of <hi>Conjugal</hi> Inſtitution, untimely are produc'd.</p>
               <p>The Two <hi>Firſt</hi> Diſtinctions the Civil Law admitteth to a priviledge of <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> and ſometime the <hi>Latter,</hi> when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſome Accident, that Nature was diſturbed in her uſual courſe. Our Laws more Rationally, exclude them all from ſuch capacity: Inſomuch, as the ſucceſſion of Families, (in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:31280:70"/> regard of their Poſſeſſions) ought to be preſerv'd, ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pure, as not to become ſubject to the blemiſh of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuggeſtion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Illegitimate</hi> coherence of <hi>Children</hi> may alſo bear the ſame diſtinction, being ſuch either <hi>Properly</hi> or <hi>Improperly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Properly,</hi> ſuch as without Reference either to Preceeding or Succeeding contract, at any time are produced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Improperly,</hi> ſuch, as with Reference either to Preceeding, or Succeeding contract, or unto both, untimely are produced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latter</hi> Diſtinction of Illegirimacy may ſometime plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly (in reference to many circumſtances in the Tranſaction) by eſpecial Grace of Prince or People, be admitted to a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of <hi>Legitimacy.</hi> The former regularly and without <hi>Oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> never.</p>

               <p>How farr the Agreement ſhould extend to form the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ution regular may probably frame an Argument material in Diſcuſſion. Beſides the Principles both <hi>Pater &amp; Patria</hi> are concerned in the Agitation, nor can either juſtly be excluded in conſent to the Tranſaction. The <hi>Parenty</hi> in reſpect, a Member thus becomes deſected from the Family; The <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society,</hi> in regard no alteration of Order in ſo Eſſential a Diſtinction can juſtly be admitted in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a publique Act, ſo that we may hereby conclude the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to his Property muſt paſs under the Title of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

               <p>Whither the Paternal Inherencies, as <hi>Lands, Goods, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> &amp;c. may juſtly be transferred with the Perſon to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Family, is a <hi>Subject</hi> materially conſiderable, and may poſſibly without oppoſition paſs in the Negative; inſomuch as the common Affluence tending to ſupport but one peculiar <hi>Stock,</hi> becomes enfeebled, when diverted to the enlargement of another.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>Servants</hi> in Reference to their Uſe and Nature, have a vaſt extent in their Diſtinction, as <hi>Bond-ſervants</hi> and <hi>Free-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, Domeſtiques</hi> and <hi>Retainers, Fealiſts</hi> and <hi>Facultiſts.</hi>

                  <hi>Bond-ſervants</hi> are diſtinguiſhed in the Perpetuity of their Servitude, terminating only with their Owners ſpecial Grace in a publique Enfranchiſement, or by the Common Law of Nature.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Theſe</hi> there are ſundry ſorts of <hi>Acquiſition,</hi> The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and moſt Antick, was, queſtionleſs, the chance of War,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:31280:71"/> which inevitable Thraldom to the vanquiſhed, was probably the higheſt and the juſteſt Motive to a generous oppoſiition. The hope of future enlargement, tending but to unnerve the Reſolution. But Man contracting ſtill corruption with the Time, formed hereto another <hi>ſpecies</hi> of <hi>Acquiſition,</hi> the victor not contented with the uſe and Glory of <hi>Theſe</hi> living <hi>Trophies</hi> to his valour, made them the <hi>Subject</hi> of his Avarice in a ſordid Traffique. 3. To <hi>Theſe</hi> two kinds of <hi>Acquiſition</hi> ſucceeds a <hi>Third,</hi> not altogether properly ſo term'd, in reſpect it ſeems framed on a voluntary Conceſſion, where the <hi>Bondman</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining by publique Ordinance: the privilege of Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement, prefers his Bondage 'fore his Liberty, not accepting the Permiſſion, whereon <hi>the Maſter nailing his Ear to the Poſt of the Houſe, became entitled to his uſe for ever.</hi> Yet may this probably be judged an <hi>Acquiſition</hi> of Benignity, which in his former Bondage had ſo engratiated the ſervant, he could not hope to improve in future his Condition.</p>
               <p>4. From theſe Diſtinctions of <hi>Acquiſition</hi> may poſſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a <hi>Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 chunk">

               <p>Whether the Authority of the Lord over his <hi>Bondman,</hi> juſtly might extend to Life and Death, is an Argument may properly be here reflection. The practice of moſt <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths</hi> in which this ſort of ſervitude was formerly in uſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it regular.

The weight of <hi>This</hi> Propoſition chiefly depends upon the <hi>Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> adherence to the <hi>Civil frame,</hi> to which admitting him a Member, he juſtly then may claim a priviledge of ſecurity from the <hi>Civil</hi> Rule, if not admitted ſuch, he muſt at leaſt be yet allow'd to be a <hi>Civil</hi> Property inherent to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> benefit, which no way can be wilfully deſtroy'd, without a common prejudice, ſo that if the Fact prove not a criminel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquence, it of neceſſity muſt be adjudged a publique Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs; which concluſion alſo will meet a farther impropriety in Rule, ſince every <hi>Bondmans</hi> life extinguiſhed by any hand, can onely paſs the cenſure of his Price, nor falls it equaly within a <hi>Civil</hi> Reparation, if the Agent be of equal incapacity, ſo that ſuch a Liberty may poſſibly extend to a prepoſterous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

                  <hi>Fealiſts</hi> are ſuch, who by the Tenor of a real Poſſeſſion, owe perſonal Service or Vaſſalage to the peculiar Lord, and might not altogether improperly be reduced to the Diſtinction of a Bondage.

In Reference to ſuch Conſequence might probably become inſtituted the firſt Title of Inherency, as <hi>Feofs en taile,</hi> where the nigheſt male ſucceeds to the Poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Subſequent to <hi>Feofs en taile,</hi> are <hi>Feofs ſimple,</hi> where the <hi>Real</hi> Poſſeſſion deſcendeth to the Heirs General, under which Title Cuſtom admitteth the <hi>Primogenitor</hi> alſo to ſucceed to the Succeſſion, reſting only this Difference betwixt <hi>This</hi> and the former Title of Inherence, that herein the Poſſeſſor hath a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to diſpoſe of his Poſſeſſion, in preſent or future, where and how he pleaſeth, in the <hi>Former</hi> neither, being but Tenant for Life, and the next Male, lineally deſcended, muſt, though againſt his liking, become inveſted in the Right of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

               <p>Theſe Titles of Inherence have alſo Reference to certain <hi>Tenors,</hi> and are either held in Capite, Soccage, Knight-Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But why ſuch Diſtinction of Tenors ſhould remain, where the perſonal Engagements are diſſolved, may prove an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a farther Inquiſition: beſides theſe general <hi>Tenors,</hi> there are alſo with us, cuſtomary or particular <hi>Tenors,</hi> as <hi>Cavil kinde,</hi> where every Party equal in Proximity, is admitted to an equal partage in the poſſeſſion, <hi>borrow Engliſh</hi> where the youngeſt only.</p>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31280:73"/> of Retraction, may become void and divided from the Right of a Succeſſion, without any voluntary Act or Surrender, it properly may fall under this Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Real</hi> Poſſeſſion being originally derived from the <hi>Civil</hi> Inſtitutor, whether his Inveſture therein were conſtituted by Agreement, or the Sword.

A plauſible Inſtitution to preſerve agreeing <hi>Simitry</hi> in each Part of the <hi>Civil</hi> Structure, lend bounds to inſatiate Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, and ſuccor to the Indigent.

In which caſe, if feaſable, a <hi>Donation</hi> might fall under the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of an <hi>Acquiſition:</hi> In all other Reſpects the ſucceſſors have a juſt Title of Inherence to the poſſeſſion, and can no way be alienated without Injury, till the ſuccesſion fail.

               <p>1. <hi>The mutual Diſaffection of the People,</hi> without Queſtion lendeth the firſt Combuſtable Matter to a <hi>Civil</hi> Diſſention, and may properly be tearmed the Tinder of Debate; which catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire on every ſlight Emotion, prompts the heady will to ſnatch at every ſlight occaſion, that may Miniſter to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and to juſtifie the Reſentment, though never ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and warrant the ſatisfaction, though never ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; moſt fly unto the Law, which both in the Procedure and Iſſue, leaving freſh Matter to more violent Debates, inſtead of apeaceable Deciſion, multiply an impetuous Diviſion: On which inevitable Conſequence of humane Infirmity, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt Legiſlators maturely reflecting, have endeavour'd to erect the ſtructure of their <hi>Civil</hi> Society, chiefly on the Baiz of a mutual Unity, Concinity, and Agreement of the Parts thereof, utterly removing all <hi>Obſtacles</hi> might therein viſibly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their happy enterpriſe; and imploying all the <hi>Ayds</hi> imaginable, might either through Uſe or Advantage, Form in them the perfect'ſt Habit of Affection, more ſtrictly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Tranſactions the Rights of Amity, then of Juſtice; as may, in Reference to the firſt part of the Aſſertion, appear in <hi>Licurgus, Taking away the uſe of Money from among tho La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians.</hi> Numas <hi>equal Diviſion of the Lands</hi> Inherent to the Juriſdiction among the <hi>Romans.</hi> In proof of the ſequel afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,

                  <hi>Aſſociation of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities.</hi> Every one, if able, was enjoyned under Penalty to repair unto the publick Intercourſe of their Aſſociates, for their refection, under this Limitation, that on thoſe dayes deſign'd for Hunting, his Abſence was permitted, conditionally, The whole Society might participate with him of the ſucceſs of his Induſtry: the Reſidue was licenc't to his private uſage and his Families. According to this Rule was form'd the Aſſociation of the <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> a Sect among the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did far tranſcend the Phariſee, or Sadduce: Inſomuch, as under their inherence, none fail'd of his ſecurity, depending wholly on the mutual ſuccor of the whole <hi>Society,</hi> whoſe joynt Intereſt was engaged both to the timely, and the due ſupport of every Member of their <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. In relation to this Model were reduced the <hi>Centuries</hi> into <hi>Maniples,</hi> and <hi>Chambriers,</hi> In the <hi>Military</hi> Order among the <hi>Romans,</hi> by ſo nigh an Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to linck them in a ſtricter Union for their mutual Succor and Defence, and for encouragement to this their Coligation, to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a publick Triumph to him in Particular, that had ſecured his Aſſociate from the Enemy. Nor is the cautious Diſtinction of their <hi>Tribes,</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo nicely paſſed on Record, eſtabliſhed on any other Purpoſe or Intention, then to oblige them to an Inſeparable Conjunction in their fellowſhip for their joynt ſecurity. Our common Diſtinctions of Conſanguinity, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance and Affinity, but ſpurious Emblems are of our Relations, in Reference to the proper uſe, and primitive Inſtitution, being only kept alive by Record or Tradition, for the Advantage on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Particulars, not for the mutual Benefit of the joynt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herency, which are no otherwayes therein concern'd, then as remote Collaterals, in future poſſibility, not in preſent Act; from whence ariſeth Controverſie, Diſſention, and Debate; Batteries rather for mutual Ruine and Deſtruction, then <hi>Cytta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> for their common preſervation; whoſe effects are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and deplorable, in that they frequently are diſtinguiſht in the Tranſactions of the nigheſt Reference to a <hi>Natural <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion:</hi> On whoſe Compoſure the <hi>Civil</hi> but pretends to raiſe her perfect Structure and Eſtabliſhment: So that the Reflection of the Conſequence juſtly may beget Aſtoniſhment in a digeſted ſence, how it is poſſible the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction ſhould reſent the violation thereof, with ſo much Indifferency, ſince her Rights are to Natures but ſubordinate. Nor yet is our <hi>Poſitions</hi> only fram'd on <hi>Civil</hi> or on <hi>Moral</hi> Practiſes; our <hi>perfect'ſt Guide</hi> hath lent <hi>It</hi> a more eminent Diſtinction, affirming, <hi>Love to be the fulfilling of the Law.</hi> And how that <hi>Law</hi> ſhould meet a happy Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which purſueth not in <hi>Her</hi> Preſcriptions the Object of <hi>Her</hi> Execution, is queſtionleſs in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules a viſible Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31280:75"/> whether it be in the Imperfection of <hi>Her Nature,</hi> or Impropriety of <hi>Her Order.</hi> Whether in the Coruption of <hi>Her Miniſters,</hi> or <hi>Error in their Practice,</hi> whereby the Members of a <hi>Civil</hi> Union may either be o're-powred, or enſnared in a <hi>Civil</hi> Tranſaction, leſt any Grievance or Oppreſſion hapning under ſuch a procedure, might inſtigate the ſufferers (judging the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>Thereof</hi> by the Conſequents) utterly to deſert thoſe <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> whereon the <hi>Civil</hi> Fabrick chiefly was erected, and follow ſtrange Chimero's of their own Invention, ſo form in their Diviſion, ſuch a Rupture in our <hi>Common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may extend to the ſubverſion of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame.</p>
               <p>From the Reſult of this our preſent Argument, will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enſue a due Perpenſation of the next <hi>Collateral Impediment</hi> to the Intention, Propriety, and uſe of the Law. The firſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being the common Clauſe of a <hi>Civil</hi> Diviſion, the ſecond of a Relapſe; In Regard that the <hi>Dammage</hi> and <hi>Diſparagement attendeth on the Procedure and Iſſue of the Law,</hi> produceth in the reſentment of the Agitators new paſſion for Revenge on any frivolous Pretence, which frequently are purſued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till both the Parties thereby become ruin'd with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. To remove this unhaypy Conſequence from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Law, whoſe proper Object only is, <hi>Suum cuique reddere &amp; conſervare.</hi> It will be highly requiſite to the Propriety of a <hi>Civil</hi> Inſtitution, in Reference to a Plea, that neither in the Iſſue or Perſuit <hi>thereof</hi> be left remaining either ſting or ſcar between the Agitators, which uſually are therein enduced, either by <hi>Perſonal Diſparagement, Indignity or Diſgrace. Or Dammage in Coſt or Delay. Or Burden of the Penalty.</hi> The former and the latter inconvenients may eaſily be rectified in a <hi>Plauſible Summons</hi> only, and a <hi>feiſable Reparation.</hi> The ſecond not without Difficulry, in Reſpect the inevitable charge, which attendeth the Proſecution of a Plea, is not any other way diſtinguiſhable to be avoided, It ſeeming altogether Impoſſible, that ſo numerous a multitude ſhould daily wait on the Proceeding of our <hi>Civil</hi> Agitation without any Advantage, more then the Demerit of the Action. In Reference to the Aſſertion, we may affirm, that there can not be a more honourable or ſatisfactory Imployment deſigned to any Perſon, whoſe fortune ſhall afford him vacancy from the urgency of his own Affairs, inherent to the neceſſity of his own ſubſiſtence, then to lend a voluntary asſiſtance to ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Miniſtry, according to the Capacity and Number of his Aſſociates: Such was the procedure of thoſe ancient He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes, whoſe Vertue only lent a more ſplendid Luſtre to the Dignity of their Countrey, then all the Glory of their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In Reference to which pattern he conform'd his practice, whoſe vertue juſtly had entitled him with the Denomination of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31280:75"/> her Eſſence, <note n="*" place="margin">Sen.</note> 
                  <hi>Cato,</hi> daily repairing from one Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to Another, to plead without Pretence of Gratuity, the Cauſes of the Indigent and oppreſt, till he was (of a ſtranger and obſcure Extraction) held worthy to become admitted to the higheſt <note n="*" place="margin">Cenſor.</note> Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>But admit the parallel (in favour of our Infirmity) more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for our ſpeculation, then our Imitation; might not Courts of Judicature be conſtituted in every County at the <hi>Publick Charge,</hi> allowing a ſufficient entertainment annually to ſuch a Number of Officiates, as might be fit to mannage the Affairs Co-incident to the Bounds of each peculiar Juriſdiction, whoſe Number being reduced into ſeveral Diviſions, might alternately officiate ev'ry Moneth: ſo that the daily Agitation of the Court yielding a ſpeedy Iſſue to their Pleas, they rarely could become o're-burdened in their Functions, either to their own Inconvenience, or anothers Prejudice: eſpecially if no Action were admitted pleadable, which had not paſſed the Allowance of a peculiar Arbitrator, who might be ſo impowr'd as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a multitude of Frivolous Debates, which uſually do but multiply one another to the Diſturbance of the common Peace, and the Dammage and Deſtruction of the Agitators.</p>
               <p>In oppoſition to which Order may probably be alledg'd, that the inevitable Charge attendeth on the Iſſue of the Law, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly encounter a more juſt and proper Impoſition, then that the Burden of the Agitation ſhould fall upon the Injurer. The Objection may paſs as an irrefutable Poſition, provided the Concluſion fall under the Reſtriction of <hi>a clear Capacity to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh,</hi> and <hi>a full Ability to perform.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where the ſence of the Law is involv'd with ſuch Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Myſtery, as no cauſe, how bad ſoever, doth not only finde authentick Promoters to encourage the undertaking, but as impudent Advocates to maintain the Proſecution under a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal formality of Right: And where the inveterate Malice of Man is univerſally ſo great, on every ſlight Advantage to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the Oppoſers of his will to ſuch extreams, as utterly might ruine and deſtroy them. It plauſibly may be allowed very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the Eſtabliſhment of a <hi>Civil</hi> Welfare, that the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators ſhould reflect on a more happy Conſtitution of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, then what muſt of neceſſity thus caſt their joynt Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates into their hands would ſell them to the Inemnity and Rage of one Another, in perſuit only of their ſordid Lucre.</p>

               <p>WHen we ſhall with due Perpenſation reflect on the extent of this <hi>Principle,</hi> in Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> Tranſaction, It juſtly may produce a wonder in the ſhalloweſt Apprehenſion, that the Conſtitution of moſt Laws, in general, ſo remiſly weigh the Conſequence <hi>Hereof,</hi> as to caſt the Deciſion in the common Ballance of a caſual Treſpaſs: under which indulgence probably the Practice <hi>Hereof</hi> hath ſpread It ſelf into the moſt honourable Profeſſions, and the nigheſt Relations, not only as an Act of Prailty, but as a plauſible Habit in ſufficiency, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Myſtery of every mans Function in a <hi>Civil</hi> uſe: ſo that we might in Reaſon rather tearm ſome <hi>Civil Societies</hi> Artificial Pieces of diſguiſed Impoſtury, then Eſſential or Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Communities:</hi> In which Regard we will endeavour to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Nature, Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>Regulation Hereof</hi> moſt perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to a <hi>Civil</hi> welfare.</p>
               <p>The Nature <hi>Hereof</hi> is queſtionleſs a Breach of <hi>Truſt.</hi> Fraud only conſiſting in Reference to a <hi>Truſt:</hi> ſo that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the <hi>Civil Prejudice,</hi> that enſues the Practice, may reach as vaſt a Latitude, as the Benefit of a <hi>Truſt</hi> can properly extend to in a <hi>Civil</hi> uſage: In which ballance we will caſt the weight of our enſuing Argument, to lend us a more clear Inſpection to guide us in the due <hi>Regulation</hi> of our preſent <hi>Subject.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truſt is viſibly the <hi>Band of Common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> or the <hi>Principle conduct of a Civil Commerce;</hi> through which the nouriſhment of every Faculty therein becomes conveyed to the ſmalleſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt Veſſels of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, which received, as a regular Poſition, we may clearly from thence Collect how highly mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial It muſt be to the Improvement of a <hi>Civil</hi> Welfare to ſecure <hi>Truſt</hi> from all manner of <hi>Fraud</hi> whatever, that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:31280:76"/> ſo far as poſſibly we may, in a clear and inſubvertible Purity.</p>
               <p>In perſuit whereof, we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh the Nature of a Truſt e're we can reach our Intention, plac't in the extent of the uſe.</p>
               <p>In Reference to which Order, <hi>Truſt</hi> is a free Act of the will to impart any thing in our Poſſeſſion to anothers, under the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Retribution, either ſimply for the Intereſt of the <hi>Truſtor,</hi> or ſoly for the Benefit of the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> or generally for the mutual and common Advantage of either, or particularly for the uſe of neither; but to the uſe and Benefit of ſome other or others ſpecified in the <hi>Truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which Diſtinction, in Reference to the Act, we may obſerve two Circumſtances in manner of the <hi>Truſt</hi> to eſtabliſh it Authentick. Firſt, That it be an Act of the <hi>Truſtor</hi>'s free will, not enforc't on him by Violence, Urgency, Neceſſity, or any ſuch Advantage on the Inclination of the will. Secondly, That whatever is tranſacted in the <hi>Truſt</hi> be really without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement in the clear Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Truſtor,</hi> as his unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Property: otherwiſe, that Truſt can prove but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <hi>Truſt,</hi> which is but raiſed on the Breach of <hi>Truſt</hi> unto another, who may more juſtly claim an Intereſt in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
               <p>The Object of the Definition extends It ſelf to four Branches, the <hi>two firſt,</hi> and <hi>the laſt,</hi> have ſoly Reference to a <hi>Common <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> the <hi>Penultimate</hi> only to a <hi>Civil Commerce.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> may reach a Caſual or Impulſive Breach to render It rationally unactionable. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> but with Difficulty may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuch Priviledge. The <hi>two latter</hi> never fall under that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. In Regard the <hi>firſt</hi> Branch of <hi>Truſt</hi> hath only Reference to the Intereſt of the <hi>Truſtor.</hi> The <hi>Truſtee</hi> only accepting of the trouble inherent to the Truſt, as an Office of Amity, which is perfectly diſcharged in his endeavour to effect it; but not reaching the intention of either by caſual or impulſive Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; the Dammage of neceſſity unjuſtly is impoſed upon him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Branch of <hi>Truſt,</hi> where the <hi>Truſtee</hi> only reaps the Advantage of the <hi>Truſt,</hi> meeteth ſome ſcruple in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of a <hi>Civil</hi> Procedure, on Caſual or Impulſive Breaches of a <hi>Truſt;</hi> inaſmuch as the <hi>Truſtor</hi> pretendeth to no benefit in the <hi>Truſt.</hi> But poſſibly to his own Inconvenience, or other Diſadvantage, for a ſeaſon, hath reſigned the uſe Thereof unto the Benefit and Advantage only of the <hi>Truſtee:</hi> So that in Reference to the Priviledge aforeſaid, on Caſual or Impulſive Breaches of Truſt, We only can, in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules, lay the ground of the <hi>Truſtees</hi> Plea, upon a Right alone unto the <hi>Truſtors</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, rather then in the inefficacy of the <hi>Truſt,</hi> or the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31280:77"/> Incapacity of the <hi>Truſtee.</hi> It appearing a high Impropriety in <hi>Civil</hi> Rule to proſecute an Act of Retribution to the Dammage or Deſtruction of him to whoſe Improvement or Preſervation It only was directed; and where the ſuccor was friendly diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Advantage Caſually failing, a Reparation ſeems ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly exacted. But, as the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> to whoſe uſe only the truſt was intended, may ſeem too favourably admitted to the Exception of a <hi>Civil</hi> Procedure on Caſual or Impulſive Breach of <hi>Truſt;</hi> ſo the voluntary or Perverſe Breaches of <hi>truſt</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only to the Advantage of the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> may ſeem but too remiſly Cenſured in a Bare Reparation of the <hi>truſt:</hi> inſomuch, as Pain for Profit muſt yet make the Return but too unequally Ballanced in a due Compenſation of Right, which far more juſtly might extend to the Advantage, was thereby acquired, as a Retraction of the Intention of the <hi>truſt</hi> ſo infamouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> Branch of <hi>truſt,</hi> which tendeth to the mutual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Tranſactors, is excluded ſuch Capacity; inſomuch as the <hi>truſt</hi> is formed under a Conditional Contract, in purſuit of a common Lucre, where either runs the hazzard of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture by his proper Act, in Reference only to their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; ſo that the <hi>truſt</hi> infringed, the <hi>Truſtee</hi> voluntarily caſts himſelf on the penalty of his Covenant.</p>
               <p>The <hi>latter</hi> Branch of <hi>truſt,</hi> which requireth only the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection of the <hi>Truſtee</hi> to the ſpecifick uſe of others pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately or publickly concerned in the <hi>truſt,</hi> can pretend to no <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity to free him from a Legal Proſecution, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a Breach of <hi>truſt,</hi> in that it reſts wholly in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>truſtee,</hi> to accept or renounce the <hi>truſt,</hi> to ſeparate the Inherents of the <hi>truſt</hi> from his own property, or alter or tranſact them as his own: ſo that nothing being exacted from the <hi>truſtee,</hi> in execution of his <hi>truſt,</hi> but his own will, It ſoly is his will that can infringe it, which tending to ſo material and charitable an uſe, failing only in the Retraction and Remiſneſs of his will, he juſtly may ſuſtain the penalty of his reproachful and injurious Reluctance or Neglect. This <hi>truſt</hi> is uſually a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary <hi>truſt,</hi> which accepted, engageth the <hi>truſtee</hi> as his own proper Act, ſo far as the Capacity of the Subject will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, which may alſo be farther diſtinguiſht in a <hi>publick</hi> or a <hi>private truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Private</hi> ſo conſtituted, have frequently this Default, that they ſeldome reach to the intended uſe, when as directed to the Benefit of Children, who commonly have moſt need thereof; in that their preſent advantage is not only ſuſpended, but the <hi>truſt</hi> alſo many times ſo oft removed, e're they attain a due Capacity to exact it; that either the Inherents to the <hi>truſt</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:31280:77"/> fail, or the <hi>truſt</hi> it ſelf falleth to the Ground, wanting either real or equitable Grounds yet farther to produce it: which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſcarcely will be exactly rectified, but under the tuition of a <hi>Publick</hi> Court, conſtituted only for the ſafeguard of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as properly fall under a <hi>Civil Incapacity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>truſt</hi> exacted to a <hi>Publick</hi> uſe, ſeldom or never reacheth the Intention of the <hi>truſtor,</hi> in that the Election is not ſufficiently ſeparated from the Intereſt of the <hi>truſtees,</hi> who exerciſing their <hi>truſt,</hi> as if only eſtabliſht for the Advantage of their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, mutually aſſent to the Remonſtrance or Interceſſion of one another, in favour of Particulars: whereas every Member of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> under the Capacity of the <hi>truſt,</hi> ought to have an equal Priviledge in the Benefit <hi>thereof.</hi> And having, without juſt exception, atteſted his Capacity in Preſentation, ſhould by equal Lot be caſt into a viſible and orderly Reception with the reſt, from thence to be extracted by an impartial hand. Farthermore, in ſuch partial Elections, all Abuſes and Breaches of <hi>truſt</hi> whatſoever, become utterly ſmothered by taking away the freedom of Impeachment from thoſe are ſoly intereſſed in the <hi>truſt,</hi> in a ſervile Adherence to the patronage of the <hi>truſtees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude our Diſcuſſion of the Nature of our <hi>Subject,</hi> we may pertinently here inſert one General Exception againſt all the former Branches of a <hi>truſt,</hi> That none of them be paſſed under ſuch a form, oblickly conſtituted for collateral and impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit uſes, not expreſt in the <hi>truſt:</hi> which Procedure may juſtly be excluded the Suffrage of a <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction, being the common ſhrouds to the moſt ſpecious and Conſiderable <hi>Frauds</hi> in Practice.</p>
               <p>As to thoſe Forms of <hi>truſt,</hi> paſſed on Contracts of <hi>Marriage,</hi> they ſeem improperly conſtituted in the Hands of a Particular, or Particulars, of how nigh Relation ſoever; in that every ſmall Occurrent tending to the inconvenience but of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein, have commonly ſufficient Influence to o'rethrow the <hi>truſt,</hi> unto the Prejudice of the Reſt, not of Capacity to yield to the Tranſaction: ſo that neceſſity will lend us a Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to fly to publick ſafeguard for Redreſs; where ſuch Acts becoming totally irrevocable, they may infallibly attain the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per uſe to which they were directed.</p>
               <p>Under which Notion may likewiſe he compriſed <hi>Guardiant truſts,</hi> either Teſtamentary, Succeſſive, or Elective; which having, for Object only the Benefit of ſuch as are not under a capacity to act either judiciouſly, or freely for their own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, in reſpect of their <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity, or elſe the ſtrict ſubordinacy to a nigh Relation.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31280:78"/> many Inconvenients may thereon enſue) might more ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be managed under the publick Tutelage.</p>
               <p>Having thus far generally diſcuſſed on the Nature of our <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> we will proceed to agitate on the uſe <hi>thereof</hi> in ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; in the Introduction whereof we incounter ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, both in Reference to our Order, and Importance in our matter; which is, whether the <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Relation ought firſt to be admitted to a Precedency in <hi>truſt?</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion may at the firſt Inſpection appear of little Ambiguity, and as little moment, one only exception but reſerv'd: inſomuch, as we have formerly inſerted, that the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame is only form'd from the connexion and concinety of the Natural: yet when the Diſſolution of the <hi>Former</hi> may be threatned in the Preſervation of the <hi>Latter.</hi> We muſt affirm it much juſter, that one cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minel periſh in the Infringement of a <hi>natural</hi> Law, then that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny innocents ſhould be deſtroyed by the diſpenſation of a <hi>Civil</hi> Ordinance: As in matter of Treaſon, where in every Act of unviolated <hi>truſt,</hi> the <hi>Truſtee</hi> becomes an Acceſſary to the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, In which Reſpect, the Tranſaction falling between the Father and the Son, the Son may probably claim Advantage from the ſame Law of <hi>Nature</hi> to warrant his Diſcovery, as the Father might exact to enjoyn Concealment. <hi>Quiſque ſibi Proximus.</hi> Yet the Romans held ſuch Primitive Inherencies in ſo great Reverence, that they diſpenced with all <hi>Civil</hi> Tyes in favour of their Rights. A Slave might without Impeachment conceal his detected Maſter, much rather a Wife, a Childe might be admitted to ſuch a Priviledge; though the caſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may require a more exact Diſtinction; ſince after detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Attempt falls under a Capacity of Prevention: And the concealment then tends but to the ſafeguard of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, not to the Promoting the Delinquence: From whence we may conclude, that ſuch Relations may, without Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be licenc't the Protection of the Criminel, provided It reach not a participation of the Crime: which exception in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance interjected, we may without farther ſcruple, accept the <hi>Wife</hi> to the firſt and higheſt degree of <hi>truſt,</hi> ſince on her Faith we caſt the Model of our <hi>Oeconomy</hi> for the enlargement of our Fortunes; and in the Affiance of her Fidelity, we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to our Succeſſion. In Reference to theſe two Objects of a <hi>Civil</hi> Union, though perhaps unequally Ballanced, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt <hi>Societies</hi> of a <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction have paſſed the Infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her <hi>truſt</hi> under a Criminel Sentence, ſpecified in the Interdiction of theſe <hi>Principles, Adultery, Suborning a Childe, Drinking Wine, Counterfeiting Kayes.</hi> The three firſt take iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from one and the ſame Intention, which is the ſecurity of our own ſucceſſion in a lawful Propagation: the <hi>two firſt</hi> really,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31280:78"/> in regard of the Action. The <hi>third</hi> but conjectually, in regard of ſcandalous Intention. The laſt particular reflecteth only on the ſafeguard of the <hi>Civil</hi> Property, which in ſuch Infringement of <hi>truſt</hi> manifeſtly tending to a fraudulent ſubverſion; the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> Judicature conceiving them to hold one and the ſame Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the Intent, lent them but one and the ſame weight in the Puniſhment; yet with this Limitation, that the execution ſhould paſs under the Authority only of the Principal. The <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction, in all Ages, ſeeming very ſcrupulous to intervene in the Deciſion of Differences between Parties ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely united, that ſhould, in Reaſon, but enjoy one common Intereſt; ſo that if any ſuch permiſſion in a Domeſtick Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action were derived from the <hi>Civil</hi> Authority, which might in Reference to the Offence, ſeem too ſevere. It might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Treſpaſs was not only obvious, but of a very high Nature, that ſhould enforce a man ſo to divide Himſelf ev'n from Himſelf, where the very ſenſe of Nature was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently effectual to leniate the moſt rigorous Auſterity: In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to which Concluſion, poſſibly, <hi>Moſes Civil</hi> Inſtitution forbore to judge the weight of a Filial Diſobedience to lend it a Criminel Infliction, but commanded, that the Offender ſhould be brought forth by the hand of his Parent; whoſe Bowels would ev'n in the firſt Intention, have relented in a natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment, ſo to expoſe their own Fleſh and Blood to the Fury of the People, had not the offence been altogether held inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piable, But the Frailty of Humane Nature, in ſucceſſion of Time contracting new and extravagant Corruptions to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of the Natural Light, whoſe Motives now becoming not the Object of their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> muſt not, without Reaſon, fail in her Reſentment, hath juſtly deprived him of ſo material a Priviledge, without a Reference to the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction. The <hi>Civil</hi> Law not ſo much as admitting him to a capacity unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to divide his own Goods amongſt his Children, without ſufficient ground confirm'd by legal Procedure: to which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Deciſion, we will contract our former <hi>Principles,</hi> that we better may conclude on the equity of their Cenſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adultery</hi> can want no other weight to lend it a Criminel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, then the Light of the ſacred Inſtitution, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>Civil</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To ſuborn a Childe,</hi> muſt without contradiction, in Reſpect of the Conſequence, reach the higheſt Nature of a <hi>Felony,</hi> both in the Contriver and the Coadjutor: Inſomuch as the Eſtate, both Perſonal and Real, unjuſtly is took from the Natural and immediate Inherents to the ſucceſſion. As to the <hi>truſt</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the <hi>Wife,</hi> which probably might herein alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Treſpaſs; ſince Breach of <hi>truſt</hi> can properly not be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31280:79"/> extended to an actual <hi>Felony:</hi> which granted, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Felony</hi> (not extending to the <hi>Truſtor,</hi> both in Reſpect of his <hi>truſt,</hi> and that he yet remains in full Poſſeſſion of his Property) may notwithſtanding be ſo qualified, extending un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others Intereſt, betwixt whom and the <hi>Truſtee,</hi> paſſed no act of <hi>truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To drink Wine</hi> ſeems but a frivolous offence to counterpoiſe ſo rigorous an Impoſition as <hi>their</hi> Death, and probably may be rather judg'd an Inhibition only appropriated to ſome peculiar Cuſtom or Climate, then an eſſential Rule to form a rational concluſion to a General uſe: yet taken univerſally, as extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Habit in exceſs. It may be held more then a conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral circumſtance to the former impeachment, in that (without Reference to the motive thus viſibly fomented in the Practice) A Woman in ſuch Diſorder can make pretence but to a ſlight ſafeguard of her Honour: So that, both in regard of the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and Danger in the conſequence of the uſe. We juſtly may ſuſpend the Treſpaſſor from the capacity of a <hi>Conjugal</hi> Union, the ground being of ſufficient weight to exact a legal Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To counterfeit Keyes,</hi> This Interdiction was probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted under the uſage of <hi>Polygamy,</hi> where the <hi>Wife</hi> was rather eſteemed the purchaſe of their <hi>Property,</hi> then a companion in <hi>Society:</hi> in which ſervile condition of Wedlock, like ſo many ſeveral Factions, every one endeavoured by all means poſſible to enlarge the Fortune of their own Production, and extendeth only to a breach of <hi>truſt</hi> impoſed on the ſafety of our Goods; wherein, according to the Inſtitution of our Law, the <hi>Truſtee</hi> hath an equal Intereſt, although ſequeſtred from her uſe under the Tuition of another: in which Reſpect the <hi>Civil</hi> Judicature reflects not on the Nature of the Fact, but as a private Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and leaves it only to the regulation of the Principle, in whoſe capacity alone It is to ſeparate His Wife from his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> or his <hi>Property</hi> from his <hi>Wife.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Children</hi> can by the priviledge of their Extraction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be intitled to no inherence of a <hi>Civil truſt</hi> more then the Father ſhall aſſign him by his ſpecial Order; and in the Breach <hi>thereof,</hi> become only liable to ſuch correction, as the Father ſhall impoſe, without a Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> cenſure: inſomuch, as they have a collateral Right inherent to the property, and ſhould in Reaſon, need no ſtricter tye to the due Execution of their <hi>truſt,</hi> then their proper Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Servants</hi> fall under the next Adherence to a <hi>truſt,</hi> which may yet more clearly be diſtinguiſhed in an <hi>Explicit,</hi> and an <hi>Implicit truſt.</hi> The <hi>Implicit truſt</hi> extendeth generally unto the ſafeguard of his Maſters Goods. The <hi>Explicit</hi> lends a more viſible
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31280:79"/> Intimation of the Nature of this <hi>truſt,</hi> under the limits of a a conditional Preſcription: ſo that the Infringement of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit <hi>truſt</hi> may properly be tearmed a breach of Contract, though not ſo fully under the Diſtinction of a <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs, as the Explicit is: Yet if the <hi>Truſtee</hi> ſhall under pretence of his General <hi>truſt</hi> appropriate to his peculiar uſe, or otherwiſe alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Goods of his Maſter not committed to his charge, the guilty may be extended to a <hi>Criminel</hi> impeachment.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>Particulars</hi> only is eſtabliſht a <hi>Domeſtick Truſt,</hi> with Reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> Unity. Our order next requires, that we reflect on other forms of <hi>truſt,</hi> which properly may be reduced to a more general uſage, either <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>Private.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Publick truſt</hi> is either <hi>General</hi> or <hi>Special.</hi> The General is either <hi>Implicit</hi> or <hi>Explicit:</hi> The <hi>Special</hi> only is Commiſſionary; both are derived from one common <hi>Principle; Publick Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and directed to one common <hi>Object,</hi> the <hi>Publick</hi> uſe: So that falling under one common Conſequence in their Nature, they may meet one common Diſtinction in their Infringement. though in Reference to the Subject they handle, ſome have a more material extent of Dammage in their Iſſue then others: every viſible and voluntary Delinquence in a <hi>Publick truſt</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to a Crime of <hi>leſe Majesty,</hi> in reſpect, that not only the common welfare or Dammage depend on the Tranſaction: But the Dignity or Honour of a Prince or State become ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in ſuch miſcarriages, paſſing as his or their own proper Act, either in the Election of their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or in the order of their <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>General truſt</hi> in <hi>Publick</hi> Intereſt, is what every Member of a <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity, was born to in common Right of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, and may be ſpecifi'd in Acts of his <hi>Allegiance</hi> either <hi>Implicitly,</hi> as a <hi>National Injunction,</hi> or <hi>Explicitly,</hi> as an <hi>Adjur'd Preſcription.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> engageth as a <hi>Civil</hi> duty; the <hi>latter</hi> alſo, as our proper Act. A Treſpaſs againſt the <hi>firſt</hi> order may poſſibly ſeem but to infringe a <hi>Civil</hi> Inſtitution. The <hi>latter</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſacred Ordinance: The <hi>firſt</hi> may by Act of Grace become reſtored to his Purity. The <hi>latter</hi> juſtly never to be admitted to a <hi>Civil</hi> Capacity.</p>
               <p>Special Acts of <hi>Publick truſt,</hi> extending to a <hi>Publick</hi> uſe, may reach a vaſter Latitude. The <hi>National, Juſticial, Negotiary,</hi> and the <hi>Military.</hi> The two <hi>latter</hi> more properly inherent to the exterior object of our <hi>Miniſter,</hi> we have reſerv'd to their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Order.</p>
               <p>The <hi>National truſt</hi> extending to a <hi>Publick</hi> uſe, is the higheſt and moſt material Diſtinction of a <hi>truſt</hi> (implied ſuch under the Licenſe of a free Election) where the people under Commiſſion of the Supream Authority, make a peculiar choice of their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31280:80"/> 
                  <hi>Truſtees</hi> to agitate on their common Intereſts, in a <hi>Publick</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. How this <hi>truſt</hi> may become viſibly and wilfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached in the <hi>truſtee's</hi> proſecution of his <hi>truſt,</hi> is not clearly obvious, where the leſſer Number muſt of neceſſity recede unto the Greater, unleſs it might be imputed to a Remiſſneſs in his Agitation. If any Subject ſhould fall in diſcuſſion, which might poſſibly be repugnant to the peculiar Intereſt of the <hi>truſtors.</hi> The <hi>truſtee</hi> led by Integrity, and Judgement, may, without blemiſh, promote the matter, tending more univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Advantage of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, ſince the whole <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> conſiſting of many <hi>truſtees,</hi> can properly form but one Body of <hi>truſt,</hi> whoſe object is not the welfare only of ſome peculiar parts, but of the whole Structure. Neither is the <hi>truſt</hi> tranſigned to the <hi>truſtee</hi> by the People, other then a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral <hi>truſt,</hi> whoſe original reſideth in the Supream Authority; to whoſe Councel <hi>they</hi> are ſummon'd to conſult on the welfare of the whole <hi>Frame.</hi> So that the Infringement of <hi>truſt</hi> muſt properly be derived, <hi>Either from the Peculiar Exerciſe of their Office,</hi> or the <hi>General Object of their uſe,</hi> inherent to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>truſtor,</hi> and diffus'd from thence to the Collaterals. The Office is ſoly poſited in Council, not in Rule; to Conſult, not to Determine; to Remonſtrate, not to Conclude; to Apply, not to Exact; to Preſent, not to Enact: All ſuch Improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the <hi>Publick</hi> Tranſaction of the <hi>truſtee</hi> may properly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the infringement of the Publick <hi>truſt,</hi> if ſingularly not cleared in a Publick Atteſtation.</p>
               <p>The General Object of their uſe, is in one common Agreement the <hi>Publick Good;</hi> but that <hi>Good</hi> ſometimes not rightly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, wanting a due coherence with the Principle, whereas rightly underſtood, the Intereſts of the Prince have ſo nigh a Reference with thoſe of the people, that they are properly but <hi>termini Convertibiles.</hi> The Benefit of the Prince being the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the People, and the Advantage of the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Benefit of the Prince; ſo that of neceſſity, who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the one, impaireth the other, and conſequently falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a viſible Delinquence of that <hi>truſt,</hi> which was impoſed on Him in the Tranſaction.</p>
               <p>The next ſucceeding Act of ſpecial <hi>truſt,</hi> is the <hi>Juſticial,</hi> or <hi>Juſticiary,</hi> which paſſeth alſo under a Commiſſionary Form. This Diſtinction of <hi>truſt</hi> hath apparently a material Influence in a <hi>Civil</hi> welfare, and ſeems but too abſtruſely limited in the capacity of the <hi>Principle,</hi> where ſo many <hi>Subſtitutes</hi> neceſſarily depend on the Tranſaction, unleſs we might conclude them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to all Miſcarriages, as viſible Defaults in their Election. Suffrage or Incircumſpection, too heavy a Burden for him to undergo, is only called to the ſimple <hi>Expoſition of the Letter,</hi>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:31280:80"/> 
                  <hi>and the Regularity of the Court.</hi> Yet nevertheleſs, ſince every material infringement of <hi>truſt</hi> muſt be enlightned by the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the will (not diſtinguiſhable, but in an equal Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance clearly preceding to exact the Remedy) either in <hi>Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Difficulty,</hi> or <hi>Defect</hi> to our Addreſſes, may render the ſaid <hi>Principal</hi> impeachable in his <hi>truſt.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Private truſt</hi> extending to a <hi>Publick</hi> uſe, holds only Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to a <hi>Civil Commerce,</hi> although ready money, or other viſible Commodities may poſſibly paſs in exchange between the Agitators: yet inſomuch as there muſt be in equity, an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate rate to every Commodity, which extended either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſential or adulterate Gloſſes, ſerious Atteſtations, or any other Manner of Circumvention, on the Ignorance, Inſufficiency, or Credit of another beyond the <hi>extrinſick</hi> value, is an actual <hi>Fraud</hi> tending to the ſubverſion of that General <hi>truſt,</hi> ſhould dignifie and ſupport a <hi>Civil</hi> welfare; in which Reſpect, the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge lent the ejected <hi>traders,</hi> no other Diſtinction then <hi>Thieves;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> had formerly noted their Incapacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Integrity. This inconvenience hath taken Root in moſt <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> either through <hi>a Licentious tolleration,</hi> or a <hi>Difficulty in Regulation.</hi> Pretences of Improvement, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Trade probably uſhering an Indulgence to the <hi>Former,</hi> while Lux and Neglect lent Obſtruction to the <hi>Latter;</hi> every one no farther weighing a General Intereſt, but in reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own particular: So that the whole Method of a <hi>Civil</hi> Commerce, becomes but one general intercourſe of <hi>Pippery:</hi> But it may here poſſibly be objected, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order may ſooner fall under every Mans Obſervation, then any Mans Regulation. In Reply we will only return a Pattern from ſome Particulars, as the common Materials to our Livelihood; which, under ſundry <hi>Civil Societies,</hi> have their publick, known, and limited Impoſition of Rates, riſing and falling, as their depending Exigents require: From which method we may col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Paralel to a more General uſage.</p>
               <p>For Cloſure of our Argument, as an equilibrate to this <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs, in General; we may caſt into the Ballance a due Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the eſſential Dammage in Relation to the Fact; which reaching not a due Reparation to the Offence in a meer impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Reſtitution, being but a bare Conſequent to the Caſual Diſcovery: we muſt yet exact a weightier Impoſition to lend the Crime an equal compenſation, contracted from the more potential Iſſue, in Reference to the Intent, where the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment meets an equal Conſequence in the Adventure: It may otherwayes be figured a Game but at half Stakes, where the Winner draws nothing but his own, and the Loſer hazzards no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Aire, in the Impeachment of his Fame, as the due
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31280:81"/> Penalty only to the Infringement of a Publick Inſtitution, which might juſtly extend to a <hi>Civil</hi> Incapacity.</p>
               <p>Neither is the infringement of a <hi>Private truſt</hi> alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under the Latitude of a <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs, where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Of equal weight, and far more juſtly, in Reſpect of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, may hereto be annexed Acts of <hi>Juſticial Perjury,</hi> from whence a Dammage not only is contracted to particulars; but <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf thereby becomes Impeachable, raiſing her Fabrick on a corrupt Foundation, unto whoſe Evidence ſhe had reſign'd her full Authority.

               <p>HAving formerly ſearched into the Nature of this <hi>Principle,</hi> in Reference to the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Natural Union,</hi> we will here Reflectt on <hi>It</hi> in Relation only to the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Civil Property;</hi> wherein we may firſt generally obſerve, that no <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs whatever more highly infringeth the order of a <hi>Civil Society,</hi> then <hi>Violence,</hi> however figured, being as it were, a private Inſurrection againſt the <hi>Civil</hi> Power; In which regard, 'tis probable our Laws do interdict, that any one in ſuch a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure</hi> ſhould become reinveſted in his <hi>Property,</hi> though viſibly never ſo injuriouſly detain'd: And on this Conſideration only have poſſibly formed the ſeverity of their Penal Statutes againſt Acts of Felony, which ſeldom are ſpecifically committed, but under ſome degree of <hi>Violence,</hi> though frequently the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe may finde no Oppoſition: for whether ſuch Goods aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med were under ſafeguard of <hi>Houſe, Pail, Wall,</hi> or <hi>Ditch,</hi> or other Encloſure; yet nevertheleſs, the indirect Ingreſſion or Exterſion manifeſt in the Act, is without other Circumſtance a perfect <hi>Violence,</hi> whether <hi>Manable</hi> Goods, and unguarded in <hi>Waſte</hi> or <hi>Common,</hi> may properly fall under ſuch Diſtinction, is not ſo clearly evident, unleſs they have a proper Signature, or Brand peculiar to the Bounds of ſuch a Priviledge, beſides <hi>that</hi> of the owner: Otherwiſe paſſing but under Notion of a Common Stray, the Fact may ſometime want Diſtinction, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with Miſtake. As to Goods <hi>Immaniable</hi> or <hi>Wilde,</hi> to which no one can properly lay a juſt claim of Right, but as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incidents to the Preſcription of their own Poſſeſſions. The
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31280:82"/> matter of their taking, though within compaſs of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bounds, can queſtionleſs extend but to a <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs, unleſs in oppoſition of their Keeper, if forth their Limits ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they juſtly pay the Forfeit of their Dammage.</p>
               <p>What other Circumſtance in Particular, with Reference to <hi>Place, Matter, Motive, Manner,</hi> or <hi>Meaſure,</hi> may either aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or lenefie the Matter or Nature of the Offence, we farther will endeavour to diſcover.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Place</hi> can lend no other weight to the offence, then what may thereto be appropriated, in Reference to the perſon damnified; which not extending any farther Detriment, then barely the privation of his <hi>Goods,</hi> may yet be weighed in a higher Conſequence, either taken violently from his Perſon, whereſoever encountered, or from his Houſe, the place of his ſecurity: Inſomuch, as Nature prompting every one to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, either in Oppoſition or Perſuit; both equally adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd by the Injured, with hazzard of his life, may equally be ballanced with the Forfeiture of his, ſhall wrongfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Iſſue.</p>
               <p>The Quality of the materials may ſometime amplifie the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Offence; as Goods conſecrated to a holy uſe, where the Malefactor not only makes an hoſtile Incurſion upon <hi>Civil</hi> Rights, but in contempt of his Creator's Ordinance; yet farther ſeems to violate and caſt off the Rites of his Exterior Worſhip, ſhould binde us in one common Union by his impious Sacriledge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Motive</hi> may ſometime not only vary the meaſure of the Crime, but alſo change the nature of the Fact, when every Circumſtance therein ſhall tend but to ſupport the preſent ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of Nature; it being but a Reproach unto a <hi>Civil Society.</hi> to qualifie that with the Diſtinction of anothers Treſpaſs, was properly their own, either in Remiſneſs of their Circumſpection; or of Relief unto an uſeleſs or languiſhing Member of their Frame.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> alſo frequently may leniate the Nature of the offence, where the negligence of the ſafeguard may Miniſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the attempters practiſe, and inſtigate a facile Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a Deſign, not formed in his purpoſe: In which Reſpect perhaps our Laws reflect on the depriving of our Goods by ſlight, when under perſonal Tuition, with no more ſeverity then a petty Larcin.</p>
               <p>The <hi>meaſure</hi> or value of the Treſpaſs can lend us but a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſpection into the weight thereof to moderate or aggravate the Nature of the Attempt: For as a ſmall matter may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time prove an evidence to a high neceſſity or Indigence, ſo may It often be an Argument of an habitual inclination to a vitious
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31280:82"/> Cuſtome, which may yet probably be further diſtinguiſhed in the frequency of the Fact.</p>
               <p>Having thus enlightned the Nature of our <hi>Subject</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with ſome material Circumſtances <hi>therein.</hi> We will inſiſt to agitate <hi>thereon</hi> with more peculiar Reference to the <hi>Civil Property.</hi> Every <hi>Perſonal violence</hi> tending to Alienation, under what Relation ſoever, <hi>Wife, Child, Servant</hi> or <hi>Principle,</hi> is without doubt a <hi>Criminel Treſpaſs:</hi> not only, in that a private Perſon is thereby uſually reduced into Bondage, and the whole Family ſuffer under the calamity of the Outrage. But the <hi>Civil Society</hi> becomes thereby diſmember'd of a Branch belonging to their <hi>Common union,</hi> in an hoſtile Inſurrection againſt the <hi>Publique</hi> Peace. In which reſpect alone, 'tis probable the Crime ſhould meet ſo high a penalty, wherein, as in other Criminel <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> the Dignity of the <hi>Civil</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature would yet become more illuſtrated in the Reflection alſo of the Intereſt of Collaterals therein damnified</p>
               <p>A <hi>Perſonal Violence</hi> to <hi>Wife, Child,</hi> or <hi>Servant</hi> without an Alienation, may ſometime fall under the diſtinction of a <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minel Treſpaſs,</hi> as in matter of Rape, where not only the <hi>Civil</hi> but the Natural Order becomes barbarouſly perverted.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Houſe</hi> may alſo ſuffer actual <hi>violence,</hi> as in Acts of <hi>Burglary,</hi> which Outrage is juſtly cenſured as a <hi>Criminel Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> without any regard to the Materials, or ſtrength of the ſtructure; Inſomuch as ev'ry mans Habitation is to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of his Goods and Perſon a fortreſs of Defence. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Letter</hi> preſcribes hereto a certain Limitation, in reference to the Time. <hi>If the Sun be riſen on him, his bloud ſhall not be ſpilt.</hi> Whether it were that his Perſon were with the Light become diſtinguiſhable, or that the People, then rouſed from their ſlumbers, were in a capacity to purſue or attache him, is not clearly manifeſt, neither being neceſſarily inherent to the exception, which in the ground of the Interdiction annexed, ſeems explicitely thereby to have changed the Nature of the Treſpaſs. <hi>For he ſhould make Reſtitution,</hi> lending it no other weight in ſuch a Circumſtance, than a <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein the general Diſtinction of a <hi>Theft</hi> according to the Sacred <hi>Letter,</hi> from whence we may collect new Matter to an Argument Material to a farther Diſcuſſion. Whether it were more Conſonant to Reaſon and the <hi>Civil</hi> welfare to paſs ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Larcins</hi> under the diſtinction of a <hi>Civil</hi> or a <hi>Criminel</hi> Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. The prementioned Authority might ſeem to ſilence the pretence of an Objection, had not the ſpreading corruption of Mans depraved Nature daily required a more Rigorous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. In which reſpect, we will decline the Luſter of ſo eminent a Light, (though it more plauſibly might be our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31280:83"/> guide,) more clearly to diſcloſe the weight <hi>thereof</hi> in every Circumſtance, hath reference to our Frailty in a <hi>Civil</hi> Practice.</p>
               <p>In order to the propoſition we may inferr, where general Acts of <hi>Theft</hi> fall under a <hi>Criminel</hi> diſtinction, the manner of the Fact is more miſchievouſly proſecuted, on the leaſt jealouſie of Surprize, or a Diſcovery. And the Attempters life once viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly attainted, anothers Life becomes too ſlight a conſideration to lend reſtraint to farther Inſolence: So that the Rights of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture often urge to perpetrate an Evil not intended. In perſuit of their ſafety to deſtroy Another; Nor is there Matter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, when as the pilfering Circumſtance is with the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique Iſſue held equivalent. Whereas the Fact extending but unto a <hi>Civil</hi> Treſpaſs, no rational Man would wilfully incurr a greater Hazard to avoid a leſs. Where the <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> is ballanc'd with the forfeit of <hi>a Life,</hi> the Injured proſecuteth the Offender to his farther Damage, without any hope to be reſtored to his <hi>Property.</hi> Where <hi>Reparation</hi> only is the Penalty to the Fact, the <hi>Treſpaſſee</hi> becomes not only reinveſted in his <hi>Property,</hi> but makes a conſiderable advantage of the Injury. <hi>The Reſtitution reaching to a double Retribution, when the Property was taken in the cuſtody of the Treſpaſſor, when alienated extending to a Quadruple or a Quintuple</hi> compenſation, So that every Member of a <hi>Civil</hi> Society is not only hereby animated to a vigilant Circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Preſervation, but the Improvement alſo of his Property, which intentive Caution becomes remiſsly abated in a ſupine neglect, where the poſſeſſion ſeems fortified under the ſeverity of a Criminel Infliction.</p>
               <p>To which concluſion may poſſibly be alledg'd; that Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes of this Nature are ſeldome perpetrated but by perſons of a deſperate Fortune, who are incapable of other Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than a Corporal Infliction.</p>
               <p>The Objection paſſing for Receivable, may probably on a more exact Inquiſition, fortifie the former Aſſention. When we ſhall duely conſider, that who flie from a certain exiſtence by Induſtry, to acquire an uncertain Livelihood by the daily hazard of their Lives, will, queſtionleſs with greater Terror, reſent the rigorous Impoſition of their Hands, then the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Interception of their Breath. They only become indulgent to Life, who daily taſte of the indulgences of Life. It being frequently obſerved among Licencious, deſperate, and deboiſt People, that the Innocent, for a petty Salary, will caſt the fatal Lot impoſed on the Criminel.</p>
               <p>Perhaps in the Propriety of the Rule may yet appear a farther difficulty. How reſtitution ſhould really be exacted, where nothing can viſibly be Leavied. The <hi>Sacred</hi> Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion anſwers the Objection, <hi>He ſhall be ſold for his Theft;</hi> but
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31280:83"/> ſuch Impropriety may be alledg'd in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Practice not ſo warrantable: Nor was it ſo under the former Inſtitution, but with limitation of time, which not reaching the value of the Treſpaſs, in the Term preſcribed, might probably become renewed, though not explicitely implyed in the Letter. It may alſo fall under ſome Ambiguity; what advantage ſhould be acquir'd from the imployment of Perſons ſo improper for a <hi>Truſt,</hi> and ſo unapt for Labor. As to the <hi>former</hi> Inſtance, we may grant them utterly excluded ſuch capacity; and the <hi>Latter</hi> may be concluded Fruitleſs, without the high ſeverity of their Keepers, which aggravated either by the Avarice of the One, or the ſtubborn remiſsneſs of the Other, may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time probably extend unto a Breach in our Humanity. In which reſpect alone tis probable the uſe of ſlaves have ſo long been ('mong civiliz'd Nations) quite aboliſhed. But the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equally remitted to the vigilance of the <hi>Juſticiary</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may probably meet an Inſtitution more approveable, which being appropriated to the advantage of our Foreign Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Civil</hi> Frame would not only be diſcharged of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial and ſuperfluous Burden, but reap a common Benefit from their impulſive Induſtry.</p>

Whoſe Execution elſe might poſſibly ſubvert the Nature of a <hi>Civil</hi> Inſtitution, Inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on extreams of Right to render Right injurious. But though every man hath a competent Impreſſion of this Light

               </p>
               <p>Subſequent to this Diſtinction in a Civil <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> is that infrequent uſage, which our Practitioners reduce under <hi>Real</hi> and <hi>Perſonal</hi> Actions.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31280:84"/> the fraudulent mixtures of ſundry Intereſts collaterally conſiſtant with the Treſpaſſors. So the <hi>Latter</hi> may ſeem not altogether properly ſo limited; in reſpect the <hi>Treſpaſſor</hi> deceaſing, e're the Agitation of the <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> is determined, the <hi>Treſpaſſee</hi> is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally left void of reparation, though the advantage of the <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi> be poſſibly tranſlated on the Succeſſor of the <hi>Treſpaſſor;</hi> to the no ſmall impropriety in a Civil Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Perſonal</hi> Treſpaſs may ſometime poſſibly fall under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Contract, where uſually the Letter lends a Rule unto the Law; but falling under the omiſſion of a verbal Covenant, the weight thereof may reach too high a Conſequence, to lend <hi>it</hi> an exact Deciſion from auricular proof; Inſomuch, as the Principles have not waded into ſo mature a conſideration, as to become exactly underſtood to one another, much leſs unto an unadviſing Auditory, who ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily become diverted from a Subject, wherein they totally ſhould be diſintereſſed, to render thereof an Authentique Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>Having thus far made Inſpection into the General Nature of a <hi>Civil Treſpaſs,</hi> we farther in particular will adviſe of the Extent thereof, in Reference to each peculiar <hi>Property,</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to a <hi>Civil</hi> uſage.</p>
               <p>The Dignity of a Family materially conſiſting in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the <hi>Wife,</hi> we properly may <hi>Firſt</hi> reflect on ſuch Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions as tend unjuſtly to defame her Conjugal Fidelity. Not only in reſpect of future blemiſhes, may thereby be transferr'd on her ſucceſſion, to a laſting prejudice: but alſo in Regard the preſent welfare of <hi>this Civil</hi> unity, chiefly depending on their mutual Love, is thereby ſhoke, if not ſubverted in the enſueing breaches of undermining Jealouſies, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times break forth in Tragique Iſſues; ſo that it will become highly material to the ſafeguard of a <hi>Civil</hi> union, that the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Judicature</hi> ſhould make a conſiderable defence againſt ſo important a Diſorder: not to the ſuppreſſing of ſuch ſcandals as are implyed only under the ſtrict Notes of their Formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but ſuch licencious Imputations alſo as become ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with artificial and diſguiſed Gloſſes, extending to oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious terms of Infamy, though ſuch general Notes of Oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, may paſs as unimpeachable, ſeeming but to figure an unadviſed paſſion; no purpoſed deſign of Malice, in reſpect, that if ev'ry ſuch momentary diſtemper of the Mind might lend our Frailty ſuch a Priviledge, no miſchief but would find a ſhelter under ſuch Protection: and though the <hi>Civil</hi> Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature ſhould impute it but an Act of Paſſion; the common Auditory will ſcarcely ſo interpret it, in whoſe cenſure alone, the Fact becomes injurious and impeachable.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:31280:85"/>
               <p> Farthermore, the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction declining in the Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, the protection of the innocent in a plauſible ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exaſperates the fury of incenſed Parties to proſecute a Reparation of their own Election, which frequently extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a deplorable Iſſue, reverts the Guilt upon the <hi>Civil</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; whoſe remiſs Inſtitution had lent Licenciouſneſs to the fomenting of ſo high Diſorders.</p>
               <p>This ſcandalous <hi>Imputation</hi> extending to a <hi>Criminel</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment (according to the Conſtitution of divers <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdictions) may farther juſtly meet an Attribute of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nature then a <hi>Civil Treſpaſs:</hi> although moſt <hi>Laws</hi> have (under ſuch a Reference in their cenſure, not viſibly implyed ſuch Diſtinction. Where the Charge is ſo invectively inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, that the Life of the Innocent becomes caſt into a doubtful ballance. To warrant the aſſertion Regular; we ſhall need to inſert no farther proof, then what we may collect from Sacred Practiſes, as the Prophets Impoſition on <hi>Suſanna</hi>'s malicious Proſecutors. So likewiſe other <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> of Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation reaching to a Criminel Impeachment (though inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectualy ſucceeding in the Proſecution) incurr equivalent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, though perhaps it may be inſtanced, that Laws have in the weight of each Tranſaction, no other Object to direct their courſe, then the Reſult of thoſe occurrents onely fall in Act, without reflection on the Intentional, which rarely are diſcoverable.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the Objection is reply'd. That every general <hi>Axiome</hi> of ſuch Dignity, to become proper to ſo conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a <hi>Structure,</hi> ought to have ſuch <hi>Solidity</hi> in the Poſition, that every Branch <hi>Thereof</hi> ſhould alſo thereto become Regular. But the true Efficacie of this Rule hath but uncertain Tenure. As we may viſibly inferr on Acts of <hi>Slaughter.</hi> Where the Fact becomes diſtinguiſhable in her Nature, only by ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as may give Light to the Intention. And in matter of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> where the intention only (without any reference to the Fact) becomes impeachable.</p>
               <p>But where ſuch <hi>Defamation</hi> extending to a <hi>Criminel</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment is legally not proſecuted. The Nature thereof que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, may properly be diſtinguiſhed within the Limits of a <hi>Civil Treſpaſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farthermore, Since all Acts of <hi>Defamation</hi> are no other ways Actionable, then as they may become prejudicial to Life or Livelihood. We may here alſo reflect on the Capacity of the <hi>Wife</hi> in reference to a <hi>Civil</hi> Function, which ſometime, poſſibly, may be divided from the Husbands Commerce. And in Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions ſhould impeach the Fame in <hi>Civil</hi> Rules may bear an equal weight, as if ſhe were the <hi>Principle.</hi> But where the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation

               <p> On what ground the <hi>Female Servant</hi> is enfranchis'd from her Contract, on Tranſaction of her Nuptials, under the favour of ſome Laws, is a difficulty not eaſie to unfold.

In that the Male excluded from the grant of ſuch a Priviledge, is equally endued with the ſame capacity; ſo that the Procedure muſt be admitted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inſcrutable, or partially inequitable.</p>
               <p>Under the diſtinction of <hi>Office,</hi> may properly be imply'd the Nature of our <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty or <hi>Function,</hi> which either <hi>Publique</hi> or <hi>Private</hi> is ſundry ways impeachable in a common Prejudice.

And the whole Society diſcouraged in their undertaking, not only to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate but the Publique Prejudice.</p>
               <p>All the ſucceeding Adherents to a <hi>Civil</hi> Intereſt, <hi>Houſe, Lands, Goods</hi> and <hi>Chattels</hi> may properly in reference to our preſent Subject be reduced under One and the ſame Forme of Diſcuſſion.

The <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> more maturely tranſacted, is with more Difficulty retract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and uſually conveigh their force to a ſucceſſive Inherency; Both in their diſtinct Notion (as formerly imply'd) lend Rules unto the Law. Yet with this Limitation, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof, become no way repugnant to any one Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Law. No private Act being Legally receiveable, which tendeth to infringe a general decree. Our Laws extract the weight of ſuch an Introduction only from the publique Intereſt; as in diſanulling Private Acts intending to conveigh Poſſeſſions, that are Real, when wanting ſuch or ſuch Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. The Civil Law more frequently forms an exception to the Procedure, in reference only to the Private Intereſt. As in Repeal of Private Acts are conſtituted to paſs away E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates are real, under ſuch or ſuch Proportion to their value: or, in Redemption to transfer Them to Proximity.</p>
               <p>In which Reſpect, it will be highly neceſſary to the exact ſecurity of our common Intereſt, that they might be paſſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Remonſtrances as might not only lend them a <hi>clear Authentique</hi> and inſubvertible ſenſe in the Letter, to conveigh the intention of the Act, under <hi>Allowance</hi> of the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> we might be freed from the Impoſturie of <hi>Schicaneurs,</hi> Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious vermine to a Common welfare, and reproachful Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Dignity of the Law.

The Law muſt elſe in the Permiſſion, but make work for <hi>her</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, leaving an entrance to ſuch <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> may poſſibly not fall within capacity of Reparation, which more effectually cannot be conſtituted, then under Publique Regiſter, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Recogniſance, where every contract might take place ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Precedence of their Introduction, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their Nature, in reference to a Priviledge in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, might lend them weight to ſupercede each other. No con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional contract under limitation of Time ſuſpended longer from a Legal Iſſue, then the uſual Term of their Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leſt any One might interpoſe Anothers Proſecution.

               <p>Such Forms of ſpecial Contract, falling under a viſible Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Truſt,</hi> may alſo uſefully be removed from the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of ſiniſter Practiſes under Regulation of the Former Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod;

But where the cauſe of ſuch Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall ceaſe, or where no Ground for ſuch a Priviledge can be ſuggeſted; but the Inherents of equivolent Capacity with any other of their joynt Aſſociates in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame.

               <p>Having made Inſpection into ſome Parts of our <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> we will aſſume the overture of the <hi>Sequel,</hi> to which alone the Induction holdeth Reference; ſince whatſoever is <hi>Exacted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Form of Right, and beyond the Preſcription of Right,</hi> muſt alſo be extended <hi>to the Prejudice of our Exiſtence.</hi> To intimate the Nature proper to our Subject, the burden muſt be heavy, under whoſe ſupport a man is forc't to ſtagger. Nor is the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den judged by the weight, but by their Faculty on whom It is impoſed, which yet more clearly to diſcover, it will be requiſite here farther to imply how far the Bounds of ſuch a <hi>Difficulty in Exiſtence,</hi> as is figured may really extend. In order to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:31280:89"/> quiſition, we may infer a double <hi>Faculty</hi> inherent to <hi>Exiſtence,</hi> the <hi>Natural</hi> and the <hi>Civil;</hi> and though there may appear too vaſt a Latitude between their Exigents, to caſt them <hi>Both</hi> into one common conſequence: yet ſince they have ſo inſeparable a Dependence on each other, that the continued Breaches in the one, are but infallible Progreſſions to the Ruine of the other. We may admit them to an equal Perpenſation in their ſeveral Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Natural</hi> Exiſtence falls under a preſcription of Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only, not to impair, but to ſecure. And though the <hi>Civil</hi> Power ſeem frequently to caſt reſtraint upon her Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in reference to the Incapacity of our <hi>primitive</hi> ſupport, (whereon <hi>her</hi> Fabrick is erected) without reflection on the <hi>Latter,</hi> plac't in the Conſtitution of <hi>Her</hi> Frame. Yet the Conceſſion iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues at ſo wilde a Diſtance, that the relief may rather figure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies applied to a dying man, then timely Comforts to ſecure the living, deſiſting rather to exact from whence naught can be levied, then at a farther Diſtance to forbear in Apprehenſion of a future Exigence. To form the Inſtitution more conſiderably adjutive to our frail Compoſure, ſuch Exigents fall under the Tuition of the <hi>Civil Miniſtry,</hi> as paſſive Breaches in <hi>her</hi> proper ſtructure, who ſhould fore-run the Incidents in a timely Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either in an uſeful Imployment, or in a conſiderable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, agreeing to their proper and diſtinct capacities. The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a <hi>Civil</hi> Inſtitution being to improve our Natural Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not to abandon us in ſuch Extreams, might thruſt us on a Savage Procedure, but to ſuſtain our Frailty, when Natures Store becomes ſequeſtred from our uſe by <hi>Her</hi> Preſcription; ſo that the urgency of our Being muſt now of Neceſſity, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Civil</hi> Diſtinction, which may properly be limited in <hi>Order, Decency,</hi> and <hi>Sufficience:</hi> Under the Preſcription of the <hi>Firſt,</hi> to avoid Confuſion; under the <hi>Second,</hi> Reproach; under the <hi>Third,</hi> Indigence: And though the two <hi>Former</hi> Dimenſions appear of little Moment in Competition with the <hi>Latter,</hi> yet duly examin'd from their Dependents only are deriv'd the very Eſſence of a <hi>Civil Conſtitution,</hi> which is not plac't in thoſe oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Inveſtures, that ſeem to claim the Homages of Honour from a vulgar Senſe: But what may free us from the inſulting ſcorn of others, and our own dejecting Inconveniences; Improprieties are truly inconſiſtent with the Nature of a <hi>Civil</hi> Aſſociation, which requireth a due concinety of Parts to the Eſtabliſhment of an exact <hi>Community:</hi> So that the <hi>Civil</hi> Indulgence will be of little Efficacy to the Security of our common <hi>Properties,</hi> if to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally abandoned to the unequal Advantages of one another, when <hi>neceſſity</hi> ſhall urge ſubmiſſion: The higheſt <hi>Tyrant</hi> in a <hi>Civil</hi> Tranſaction, which the <hi>Civil Juriſdiction</hi> weigheth not,

               <p>To the Reſtraint of ſuch attempts may poſſibly be inferr'd, The Ordinance of the <hi>Civil</hi> Juriſdiction in Reference to ſuch a Procedure, under Diſtinction of <hi>Extortion;</hi> in which the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Inſtitution might probably attain an uſeful Remedy, were the <hi>Procedure</hi> more clear, the <hi>Penalty</hi> and the <hi>Reparation</hi> more conſiderable.

And though the event may be concluded to have been a Judgement ſent from Heav'n; yet are the cauſes thereby no leſs manifeſt. His Providence that bad ſo long reſtrain'd the effect, could have made void the Iſſue, under the like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, and probably from like materials, though of a Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Quality, may be derived thoſe Eruptions from the Entrails of the Earth, which undermine the Continent to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe <hi>Structures</hi> are thereon erected. The Cauſes of ſuch Accidents not falling in Capacity of a <hi>Civil</hi> Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more then in Removal of the Scituations, or Reſtraint of Licenciouſneſs, we will not here inſiſt upon. The object of our Purpoſe being more peculiarly to ſearch into the Ground and Remedy of ſuch Events, ariſing from our own immediate Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: though poſſibly, ſome of the Nature of the Latter Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may ſometime wilfully or Caſually proceed from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Malice or Neglect, as may be inſtanc'd from thoſe viſible Effects take Iſſue in ſuch Mines, as are compoſed of combuſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Materials.</p>
               <p>The moſt uſual Cauſes and more proper to a <hi>Civil</hi> Regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are thoſe coincident to our General Affairs, which are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Voluntary</hi> or <hi>Caſual.</hi>

As to voluntary Acts ariſing from the private malice only of Incendaries, they juſtly may be caſt into the Ballance of a <hi>Criminel</hi> Delinquence; How ſlight a Conſequence ſoever the Iſſue may encounter; In reference only to the Publique Damage threatned in the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,

               <p>The Prevention conſiſteth chiefly in <hi>Poſition of the Fabrick.</hi> The <hi>Materials of the ſtructure.</hi> The <hi>Separation of Coincidents.</hi> Or <hi>vigilance of the Familiſts.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Remedy to ſtop the Fury of this Evil conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the readineſs of Materials to extinguiſh or demoliſh.

For the Aſſiſtants to the work they uſually on the outcry are too numerous to be truly uſeful; ſome flock to view the Spectacle, ſome for Booty, few for Action; ſo that in ſuch confuſion, the intended ſuccour ſeldom is ſucceſsful, in which reſpect it will be highly uſeful, that the <hi>Civil</hi> Power do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a general <hi>Regulator</hi> to the undertaking, with ſuch <hi>Officiates</hi> have Judgement and Experience to manage the Direction.</p>

               <p>To the expulſion of the Maritine Incurſions. The Induſtry of our Neighborhood abroad may in their penible perſuit lend us a happy Pattern to the undertaking.

               <p>THE Expulſion of this <hi>Principle,</hi> in Reference to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our <hi>Civil Property,</hi> may on the firſt Inſpection rather ſeem a <hi>Subject</hi> proper to the Regulation of a private <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> then of a <hi>Civil Miniſtry.</hi> And in the Order of poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, more proper to improve then to ſecure our <hi>Civil</hi> Intereſt: Yet ſince we, through the Infirmity of our Nature, are become

Nor is the Intention of our Order here infringed to reduce our <hi>Subject</hi> to one uſe, might more effectually pretend unto <hi>Another,</hi> ſince <hi>Both</hi> have their Reception under one Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Nor <hi>This</hi> but the Progreſſion to the <hi>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How far the Nature of our <hi>Subject</hi> may extend it ſelf in a clear and Rational Diſtinction, to lend a Rule to this our Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may be extracted from the Inference, we formerly have inſerted in the Diſcuſſion of a <hi>Civil</hi> Exiſtence, which is not properly implyed by the bare ſupport of Nature in a Savage manner. But in the Allowance unto every Part, a Regular and Decent Conſtitution, agreeing to the proper uſe, and true Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of each Particular. Nor is It our Intention here to weigh the Nature of our <hi>Subject,</hi> as a vitious Habit in our Practiſes, which we have formerly remitted to the Regulation of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cenſor.</hi> But as an Impropriety in the <hi>Civil</hi> Order deſtructive to our proper Intereſts.</p>
               <p>What this Order ſhould require in the Compoſure and Tranſaction of each Part to form a <hi>Civil</hi> Harmony, may clearly be collected from the Diſtinction of the uſe, to which they are deſign'd. Thoſe Ornaments and Inveſtures, which are proper to the Head, or Hand, transferred to the feet, but prejudice or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber their peculiar Action. Nor doth the Impropriety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt alone in Tranſpoſition of Dependencies; but in the Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Application of their own Inherencies, proportion'd to the due Capacity of every Individual in the kinde, their Function elſe will but encounter an Imperfect Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Whether ſo ſtrict a Poſition directed to confine the uſage of our <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty within the proper and peculiar Bounds of every Currant, be really conſiſtant with the common Benefit, is not ſo clearly obvious, in that our frail Condition is patcht up with ſo many Imperfections in Compoſure, that not only our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but our very Vices are become uſeful, if not neceſſary to the conſiſtence of our <hi>Common Union: Lux</hi> and <hi>Riot</hi> being the hopeful Springs whence <hi>Commerce</hi> draws her daily Affluence, which procedure to render more Authentick, ſome will extract
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:31280:95"/> a Priviledge from the viciſſitude of Natures Inſtitution, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Corruptio unius eſt Generatio alterius:</hi> Although the Parallel be but unequally apply'd. The Intention of <hi>Her Work therein</hi> is only to preſerve <hi>Her</hi> own <hi>Production</hi> in every Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual. <hi>Ours</hi> tendeth to deſtroy both our ſelves and our <hi>own.</hi> Nor can the common conſequence of ſuch profuſe Expences, well examined, tend otherwiſe to the Advantage of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame, then as improper Aliments may ſometime in their habitual fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of uſe, become neceſſary to a depraved Conſtitution.

But greedy Forreigners with uſeleſs Trifles, Knacks, and Toyes, more frequently fleece us of other much more Conſiderable Commodities, in Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring unto ſuch Giddy and diſtempered Fantaſies.</p>

               </p>
               <p>As to the Faſhion of the <hi>Garment,</hi> moſt Commonwealths have in all Ages held their ſeveral Diſtinctions proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the order of their Miniſtry in the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had their <hi>Plaebean</hi> and their <hi>Noble</hi> Veſture: which Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was elſewhere eſſentially in uſe, till Wealth had juſtled Vertue out of Action. Now generally regarded but as a trivial Formality: under which Licenſe probably the <hi>Vulgar</hi> have with us aſſum'd their Inſolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their</hi> Difference in <hi>Materials</hi> is not in uſage of ſo great a Moment, eſpecially in ſuch Climates, where they take their primitive extraction: yet hath the <hi>Garniture</hi> met often ſuch Extravagance (ev'n where affected Vanity had won Her higheſt Priviledge) that the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, (not only in Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Dammage of Particulars, but in ſecurity to the Publick Intereſt) hath oftentimes been forced to reſtrain the Prodigality, in a general Inhibition of the uſe of <hi>Cut-Works, Embroydery,</hi> and <hi>Clinkant</hi> under Impoſition of a Penal Law.</p>
               <p>The Ornaments of our <hi>Habitation</hi> may in their Structure juſtly claim a higher Priviledge in Expence, in that they are with <hi>Ours</hi> directed to a <hi>Publick</hi> uſe, contributing effectually unto the Luſtre and Dignity of the Place or City, and bear the laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marks of Honour to a Private Family: yet with ſuch Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, that the Fabrick not extend either the uſe or Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Founder. Nor that the Interior Ornaments ſurpaſs in value their Dependancies.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:31280:95"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Special Entertainments</hi> have a prodigious Latitude in expence; not ſeldom prejudicial to a <hi>Common</hi> Intereſt, and uſually are ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, either as the <hi>Rites of Ceremony, The Pledges of Amity, The Proofs of Hoſpitality,</hi> or elſe <hi>The Masks of Furbery.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> Tranſaction is exacted, as a National Aſſociation in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, to Gratulate, or to Conſolate, to Mourn, or to Rejoyce together; as in Funeral or Nuptial Solemnities: which, rarely falling in a <hi>Civil</hi> Practiſe, may be allowed greater Liberty. The <hi>Second</hi> improperly o'reſhadowed with ſuch oſtentive Proofs, may juſtly be excluded ſuch a Procedure, whoſe nature rather is expreſſed in the mutual Freedom of a voluntary Congreſſion, then of a ſumptuous and ſingular Invitation. The <hi>Third</hi> worn out of uſe, had yet their Improprieties, Inconvenients, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances, not only to the Practiſer, but to the common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the <hi>Civil</hi> Frame; in that the order of Munificence did never reach the object of ſo ſpecious a pretence. The true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> conſiſting in the Relief of the Indigent, not in the Indulgence of the Slothful: Or in Recourſe of Jollity, forming rather a Harbour to Neceſſity, then a Receipt to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, or a Shelter to Neglect. The Luſtre of ſo high an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute muſt bear a more diſtinct Appropriation to the uſe, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the very appearance of any other Collateral Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence whatever. The ſource muſt not only be free from Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the Materials from Indecency. Not the Refuſe of Riot, but the choice of Fertility: Nor can the Diſpenſation meet Exceſs, where all may be requir'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Latter Object</hi> of Entertainment is moſt frequently but the ſecret Train to the Advancement of a private Intereſt. A Courtly kinde of <hi>Commerce,</hi> where the engaged Gueſt becomes deſigned to defray the expences of the Feaſt. But ſingularity and experience have made ſo nigh diſcoveries on the Ambuſh, that uſually the Adventure muſt be enſured in a plainer Style, delivered in more viſible and currant Characters; ſo that in ſuch enlargements, the caſualty of ſucceſs may poſſibly in time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the urgency of the Publick Regulation to a Private Caution.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Domeſtick Equipage</hi> may be implyed either in Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Quality of <hi>Servants,</hi> or in Appendents to our <hi>Service,</hi> whether for Uſe or Pleaſure. The number of Servants hath generally been reduced to a ſmaller Retinue with us, ſince Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had changed her Poſition. Few well affected to the Burden of a Multitude, or where they do exceed therein, it is but in the Quantity of <hi>Thoſe,</hi> which are deſigned more for ſhew then uſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Appendents</hi> to our <hi>Service</hi> or Divertiſements do often reach to a more conſiderable Superfluity, either in <hi>Plate,</hi>

                  <hi>Horſe,</hi> or other Appropriates to <hi>Field Divertiſements.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſe of <hi>Plate,</hi> in latter Times hath been extended to a high extravagance almoſt in every Family, even to thoſe Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils deſigned to the vildeſt Offices: which Impropriety muſt, under Suffrage, queſtionleſs, produce a viſible Obſtruction in a <hi>Civil</hi> Intereſt, where the Principle Material, that ſhould lend life to Commerce, in a perpetual Revolution, lies dead, in an improper <hi>Miniſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horſes</hi> are, under ſeveral Diſtinction, of ſo general an uſe, that their Appropriation, but in number, hardly meets Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet is the <hi>Courſer</hi> of ſo little Moment, and ſo high a Charge, both in their Breed, their Keeping, and their uſe, that the Intention of their Exerciſe may oftentimes require a <hi>Civil</hi> Regulation, in that they frequently involve the Owners in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates to a Prodigious Iſſue of Expence, wherein the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed often are expoſed to the fraud of Mercinary <hi>Combinators.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Field Exerciſes</hi> may in their frequent Practice meet a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Intention in the Times of Peace, rendring the Body apt, vigorous, and hardy to more uſeful and more generous Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, on urgency of Martial Expeditions: Yet where the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the <hi>Chaſe</hi> lies only on a ſingle Manager, the common Conſequents are uſually too weighty for a Private undertaker. Nor can the Liberty of <hi>Parks</hi> ſo generally in uſe, paſs without Prejudice to the <hi>Publick</hi> Intereſt, when as ſo many and ſuch vaſt Extents of Land are only but deſign'd to Pleaſure. The Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, rightly weigh'd, ſeems only proper to a Princes uſage: And though the Soyl may ſometime plead a Licenſe, in ſterillity; or in a farther uſe thereof for Paſturage to Horſe or Chattel: yet is the Advantage therein but of little Moment in Compenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Dammages.</p>
               <p>Nor are theſe Oftentatious Habits only in their Nature pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to our <hi>Civil</hi> Faculty; but alſo in a neceſſity of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, not leaving place to the Relucting will to make Retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Error; In apprehenſion to anticipate the evil, we in Protraction do but aggravate: which Impoſition of Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, too frequently, though oftentimes too late, becomes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by unadvis'd <hi>Commerciants,</hi> inſiſting in their Vanity but to ſupport their Credit.</p>
               <p>In perſuit of our Agitation on this <hi>Subject,</hi> order would exact we ſhould imply a courſe whereby the <hi>Civil</hi> Power might viſibly diſtinguiſh, or yet exactly rectifie the Conſequence of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper.

               <p>How the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Charge ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, or to what Objects viſibly deſign'd, we will endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>undertaking</hi> falls (without queſtion) under the Diſtinction of a <hi>Truſt,</hi> though the Truſtee ſeem e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually intereſſed in the mannaging. But uſually the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is aſſumed only under colour of Purloining for ſupply to ſome ſiniſter Purpoſes, unequal Inclinations, Secret, frivulous or ſuperfluous expences, which Practice is fomented under ſhelter of an <hi>Intereſt,</hi> or under ſhelter of the <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Intereſt,</hi> rightly underſtood, is but a <hi>Potential</hi> or collatereal Adherence, under the Diſtinction of <hi>our</hi> Rules. The <hi>Civil</hi> Law admits the ſame <hi>Relation</hi> to an equal Partage in the <hi>Acquiſition</hi> with the <hi>Principle,</hi> in what Nature ſoever tranſacted; which Priviledge may poſſibly be the Cauſe, why the Inſtitution meets a happy Iſſue, under ſo favourable a Preſcription; though the engagement hath a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler Object, where the Act is free from any ſuch Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
               <p>The Law extendeth not her Influence to the Miſcarriage of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:31280:97"/> 
                  <hi>This Truſt,</hi> in Reſpect the Conſequence is involved in a joynt Commiſſion, under <hi>One</hi> preſent <hi>Intereſt;</hi> though poſſibly the <hi>Truſtee</hi> may totally in Future be ſecluded from the Benefit. Or in that, the Authority not paſſeth under a neceſſary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but under a voluntary plauſible and endearing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Object</hi> of the Exerciſe, plac'd under <hi>Circumſcription</hi> of the Family, ſeems totally inherent to <hi>That</hi> uſe, whither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in a <hi>timely Proviſion</hi> or a <hi>prudent Diſpenſation. Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> derives her Affluence from too many and too remote ſources to exact <hi>Her</hi> vigilance, whoſe Action only is ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated onely in the Center of Receipt. The <hi>Firſt</hi> Inference of <hi>Devoyr</hi> may ſeem to approach the Nature of the <hi>Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In that, to make <hi>Proviſion,</hi> is properly but to <hi>acquire</hi> for ſtore, but the Intention confined to the uſe, can really not extend to ſo general a Diſtinction.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Objects</hi> thus deſigned to their diſtinct Ballances, we have to <hi>Either</hi> here annexed a Dependent might lend them equal Counterpoiſe; in that they held a mutual Reference to One Another. The <hi>Proviſion</hi> muſt be <hi>Timely</hi> to attain the uſe to which it was directed; when Plenty crowns the Seaſon with Succeſs, and ſets a lower Rate on the Materials, while yet occaſion preſſeth not. Not when Neceſſity ſhall urge ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply on any Terms. Prevoyance often reaps the fruit of others Induſtry. Nor can their force united be but requiſite. In that, the Latitude of a <hi>Civil</hi> exiſtence falls totally not under ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a <hi>Private Frame. Civility</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> will challenge a ſupply in Rights of <hi>Decency;</hi> ſo that where <hi>Either</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, the Conſequence muſt of Neceſſity, be prejudicial to a <hi>Civil</hi> Fadulty. The Counter-Ballance muſt to <hi>This</hi> be fram'd equivalent, to lend Them an agreeing Motion. The <hi>Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> muſt <hi>prudential</hi> be to form a timely Providence materially ſucceſsful. <hi>Exceſs</hi> meets no Preſcription where <hi>Riot</hi> tends to <hi>Diſſipation;</hi> nor <hi>Penury</hi> attains the Honour of <hi>Frugality;</hi> where <hi>gripple</hi> hands becomes the Mannagers. <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> crown Nature with Delight, while <hi>Lux</hi> but haſtens to extinguiſh <hi>It.</hi> The ſcatter'd fragments had their due Reſerve in his Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lent them Affluence by a Miracle.</p>
               <p>But how the <hi>Civil</hi> Power ſhould lend an Influence to this Circumſpection, where Love and Duty are not prevalent, is yet a Miſtery. <hi>Honour</hi> may attract, and <hi>Infamy</hi> deter, in Minds that are thereof ſuſceptable; but where the Inclination hath attain'd that Senſe; <hi>Both</hi> needleſs are to guide the Will to what is Regular. Or if <hi>They</hi> might, the Rule is yet too ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be extended to a General uſage, when Vice finds no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint in Puniſhment. The happieſt Motive, therefore can be

               <p>In Perſuit of the Intention the <hi>Spartans,</hi> who had rais'd their Glory on the Propriety of Natures uſe, left the Diſtinction thereof only to Her yet pure and unaffected Motive, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Amuſement of their Infancy; to whom they had expoſed every Forme, might be inherent to a <hi>Civil</hi> uſage. Nor was this Inquiſition yet remitted to the Circumſpection of Indulgent Parentage; or the Appropriation thereof to their Order. The <hi>Civil</hi> Power ſeems yet more nighly Intereſſed in the Conſequence, to lend the Partiality and Endearment of a Parent ſoly ſuch a Priviledge, the weight hereof they viſibly expreſſed in their Caution, when as the inſulting Foe, would have exacted an engagement of their <hi>Youth</hi> for Hoſtages. Nor was the progreſs of their Induſtry viſited, directed or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by a Private Inſtitution. The Aged and Experienc'd were publiquely the Superviſors to their ſports and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes; who both Inſtructed and Deſign'd the <hi>Price,</hi> where Emulation was inflam'd with Glory, and Neglect or Remiſneſs checkt with Infamy. Private and Mercinary Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſpin out their undertaking but under ſlight and ſuperficial Forms of Practice to the Advantage only of their abject Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre. Indifference in the <hi>Firſt</hi> Promotor will hardly animate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Adherents to a perfect Action. How far the proſecution of our Purpoſe may advance a Private Intereſt, is clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Conſequence, ſince early Habits in an uſeful <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> will lay a ſure foundation to the enlargement of our future Fortunes. Or forme a fair Retrait to the Miſcarriage of that in preſent is eſtabliſhed. Practice will entertain the Fancy with Delight; Delight win Aſſiduity; Aſſiduity removes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly that vacance might ſolicite facile Inclinations to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:31280:98"/> Practices, or lewd Society. Affords the minde a plauſible Divertiſement. And fruſtrates both the Snares of Sloth and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude; on which conſideration poſſibly <hi>this Inſtitution</hi> became ſucceſſively digeſted into Practice, among moſt Princes of the higheſt Eminence: So that we may conclude the Suffrage of affected Vacancy, under what ſhelter of <hi>Civil</hi> Affluence ſoever, endued with Capacity to act, forms no ſmall Diſcord in a <hi>Civil</hi> Conſort.</p>
               <p>To viſit yet more nighly the general Nature of this <hi>Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we clearly may diſtinguiſh by the Object we propound, the means that ſhould conduct us thither is not meerly Specular.

Knowledge muſt attain a proper <hi>Subject</hi> to be wrought upon before it can attain or Illuſtration, or uſe. The <hi>Civil</hi> Harmony conſiſteth in Agreement of Parts to a mutual Correſpondence of their Action: Not in the Amuſement of a miſtick, wandring, and undigeſted <hi>Speculation.</hi> To deſcend to a more peculiar Diſtinction, were but to trace upon a <hi>Subject</hi> we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready have elſewhere enlarg'd upon, ſo far as might be conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the due Structure of our <hi>Treatiſe.</hi>

In which Reſpect we will reflect upon the quality of ſuch <hi>Commerciants,</hi> whoſe languiſhing condition may require a ſupport from this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi> The Nature of their <hi>Attribute</hi> may properly imply ſuch Perſons as extract the means of their exiſtence from an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe of <hi>Trade.</hi> To which <hi>Diſtinction;</hi> though <hi>Publick</hi> Tranſaction more properly may agree, a <hi>Subject</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent to our preſent <hi>Agitation,</hi> extending only to a <hi>Private Commerce:</hi> Yet taken only with a Reference to their prefigured Incapacity, which lends them to a <hi>Publick Commerce,</hi> but a ſubordinate <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> We may inſiſt thereon without Conjecture of an Impropriety.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort of obſcure <hi>Subordinates</hi> in <hi>Commerce,</hi> a vaſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity might poſſibly be inſtanced; which we, in order to our propoſition, will reduce to theſe Diſtinctions, <hi>Aſſociates</hi> and <hi>Independents.</hi>

                  <hi>Aſſociates</hi> imply ſuch, as for <hi>Object</hi> of their <hi>Induſtry,</hi> have a ſpecifique <hi>matter</hi> to inſiſt upon, inherent to the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of ſome diſtinct <hi>Society,</hi> on which they do depend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Independents</hi> have no diſtinct Adherence to <hi>Community,</hi> in Function, nor yet peculiar <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Return,</hi> but generally pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue all <hi>Subjects</hi> that are vendible to the Advantage of their <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt:</hi> ſo that their differing Agitation may properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a diſtinct ſuccour to their undertakings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſſociates</hi> having in their <hi>Function</hi> a Relation to a <hi>Commulty,</hi> may properly repair to their <hi>Proviſion,</hi> to entertain their <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in their ſpecifique <hi>Miniſtry:</hi> Either deputing <hi>Money</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi> to their <hi>Truſt;</hi> and taking weekly the return of their peculiar Induſtry in ſuch Commodities, as are inherent to their Occupation, at ſuch a rate, as might in time endue them with Capacity to become ſingle <hi>Mannagers</hi> of their proper <hi>Function.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Nature of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> may probably meet ſome Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, either in Reference to the Facility of the Remedy, without ſuch Appropriation, ſince no one can ſo ſuddenly fall from the Practice of his Faculty, as not to lend ſo ſmall an entertainment to his Induſtry. Or in Relation to the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of a General <hi>Trade,</hi> ſince the <hi>Society</hi> might thereby po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attract more on their Hands. then they could without Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage iſſue.</p>
               <p>To take away the ſcruple of the firſt <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> we may imply the urgency of a quick return, to thoſe have not Capacity to wait the ſeaſon proper to Advantages, who forced to put off their <hi>Goods</hi> at any rate, both for the ſupport of their preſent livelihood, and the ſupply of ſuch <hi>Materials,</hi> ſhould lend new Affluence to their Commerce, fall by degrees to a Ceſſation in their <hi>Faculty,</hi> and totally become a prey to thoſe can firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs their <hi>Properties,</hi> or other ways prevail on their Neceſſities.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Independents</hi> purſuing not ſo material a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> in the <hi>Civil</hi> Texture, can properly not require ſo ſingular a Priviledge of ſuccour, in that they cannot be reduced by diſtinct Authority to make a mutual Retribution of the common Benefit received, when they fall under a Capacity to make an equal Reparation to anothers Indigence; in which Reſpect, we muſt remit their aid to a more common <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> which cannot be more plauſibly ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to a general uſe, then under the allowance of a Common

In oppoſition to ſo ſtrict Reſtraint of Benefit, may poſſibly be alledg'd the <hi>Caſualty of Goods.</hi> And <hi>Charge</hi> of the <hi>Attendants</hi> on <hi>Receipt.</hi>
